# Current Status

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 candidate 326: night of CPU and GPU fronts (2026-10-30, owner asleep)

`build\hwr-play-scale.ps1` points at `build\candidates\coregs2-candidate-326`: 313 + IN-446 (GS stream through a
lock-free ring), IN-447 (draw path without allocations), IN-455 (vertex queue ring), IN-450 (unchanged uploads keep page versions), IN-451
(speculative depth rejection before texturing, exact), IN-452 (CT32 uploads by whole columns, SSE2), IN-453 (texture
cache by block identity). Frames identical to candidate 310 at every check; CTest 266/267 in both interlock modes
(the known GS settings contract failure). Final comparison with 313 (headless night race, interleaved): 3x GS worker
7.19 -> 6.41 ms per VBlank (-11%), process CPU 20.2 -> 18.9 ms, EE critical path 9.69 -> 8.96 ms, frame p50 9.7 ->
8.9 ms and p95 11.9 -> 10.9 ms, GPU busy 4.16 -> 3.90 ms; 12x GPU busy 20.77 -> 20.25 ms, frame p50 24.0 -> 22.4 ms. Measured and dropped tonight:
MTVU journal slot rings (no gain), longer submission intervals (worse), textureGather (+2.6% GPU at 12x). Details in
the ledger and the journal.

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 candidate 313: CPU survey done, SSE4.1 adopted (2026-10-30)

`build\hwr-play-scale.ps1` points at `build\candidates\coregs2-candidate-313-sse41`: 309 + the CPU survey
instruments (IN-445: `GT4_CPU_SAMPLER` process sampler, `[hw] transport` line, exclusive stage times) built with
SSE4.1 (`GT4_SSE41`, now ON by default; owner rule). No visual change: frames identical to SSE2 and AVX2 builds. 3x
headless night race, medians of 3: SSE2 -> SSE4.1 10.00 -> 9.62 ms per VBlank (-3.8%, the VU1 worker -16%); AVX2 no
further gain, so no AVX2 executable. The survey (`docs/hw-renderer-spec/CORE2-CPU-SURVEY.md`) lists the CPU fronts
of the GS pipeline and transport with measured costs and a proposed task order (replay bench first, zero-copy MTVU
intake last); they wait for the owner's go-ahead. CTest 266/267 in both interlock modes (the known GS settings
contract failure from the rc7 merge).

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 candidate 309: constant fills as compute (2026-10-30, fine-tuning)

`build\hwr-play-scale.ps1` points at `build\candidates\coregs2-candidate-309`: 308 + IN-442, GT4's full-screen colour,
depth and alpha clears drawn by a compute shader with the uber shader's per-pixel functions (exact; storage writes from
compute run about twice as fast as from the fragment stage). GPU busy per VBlank, night race: 12x 21.6 -> 20.6 ms, 6x
8.0 -> 7.9, 4x 5.4 -> 5.2, 3x 4.3 -> 4.1; frames identical. CTest 264/265 in both interlock modes.

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 candidate 308: on the 1.3.0-rc7 base, flares hidden in performance mode (2026-10-30)

Candidate 308: 1.3.0-rc7 (`task/133-rc7-ra-controls`
c21e934) is merged into the branch as its base (Spec II, rc7 launcher; CoreGS 2.0 stays out of 1.3.0). Performance
mode (`-Performance`, `GT4_CORE2_PERFORMANCE=1`) now also hides the light flares and the sun glare as rc7's
Performance mode does for the PCSX2 GS (IN-441): Clubman Stage Route 5 night at 10x 18.1 -> 16.9 ms per VBlank.
CTest 263/264 in both interlock modes. Next: the owner's fine-tuning of CoreGS 2.0, then a PR to the EE optimisation
branch.

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 candidate 307: performance mode starts (2026-10-30)

`build\hwr-play-scale.ps1` points at `build\candidates\coregs2-candidate-307` in this worktree (everything moved off
the external SSD). 307 (gt4vulkan.exe sha256 a7884470...) = 306 + IN-438 (frame/depth reads only when needed, exact) + IN-439, the first performance
mode item (decision 0073, `-Performance` / `GT4_CORE2_PERFORMANCE=1`): GT4's flare-test downloads answered one VBlank
late without a GPU wait. Owner test of 306 at 10x: 43-52 FPS, GPU-bound (128-136 W). Next levers measured at 12x:
fixed-cost upkeep batching (exact, up to ~2 ms), hardware texture filtering in performance mode (up to ~1.8 ms),
full-screen fills as clears (~1 ms).

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 candidate 306: specialised pipelines (2026-10-29, waiting for the owner test)

`build\hwr-play-scale.ps1` now points at `O:\gt4recomp-scratch\coregs2-candidate-306` (gt4vulkan.exe sha256
213c29b7...): candidate 305 plus IN-437. The 12x cost was the uber pixel shader re-deciding its draw-state branches in
every wave (IN-436); pipelines specialised per draw state cut the night race GPU time per VBlank by 25-36% (12x
33.3 -> 21.4 ms, 10x 23.8 -> 15.5, 8x 15.9 -> 11.2, 3x 5.6 -> 4.2) with byte-identical frames.
`GT4_CORE2_SPECIALIZE=0` is the A/B switch. Next GPU levers, measured at 12x: the remaining fragment cost against
the 0.41 ms per full-screen pass of a fully folded shader, then D1 (ROP path, 0.21 ms per pass).

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 beta candidate 305 (2026-10-29, waiting for the owner test)

Branch `task/027-coregs2`, `build\hwr-play-scale.ps1` points at `O:\gt4recomp-scratch\coregs2-candidate-305`
(gt4vulkan.exe sha256 b10cefd8...). Done overnight on the owner's beta list (`decisions/coregs2-beta-scope`):
- 1x fixed (IN-427): the 3D scene shows at 1x (was HUD only).
- Mipmapping and LOD (IN-428): GS mip levels and trilinear; distant asphalt less noisy. `GT4_CORE2_MIPMAP=0` A/B.
- Pre-race camera-cut spike reduced (IN-429 batched readbacks, IN-430 merged dirty rectangles): 46 -> 40 ms once per
  race start; in the race the only readback left is the game's own download.
- Image memory budget (IN-431): texture cache 192 MiB on integrated GPUs (768 discrete); at 192 MiB the night race
  needs 507 MB of images instead of 621 MB.
- Presentation resampling to the exact window rectangle (IN-432): Lanczos-2 when shrinking (3x+ into 1080p, sharper
  than the old blit), FSR1 EASU when growing (1x, 2x); FSR1 RCAS sharpening optional (`-Sharpen 0.2`).
- Forced bilinear `GT4_HW_FILTER=forced|forced_no_sprite` (IN-433) and anisotropic filtering of mipmapped textures
  `GT4_CORE2_ANISO=2..16` (IN-434), both off by default (`-Filter`, `-Aniso`).
- 12x checked on the night race (1.6 GB of images, 27 ms of GPU per VBlank on the RX 9060 XT); frame dumps above the
  64 MB readback buffer read in bands (IN-435).
- Not in this beta (decided, see CORE2-ROADMAP "Beta closing plan"): fractional scales (integer scale everywhere, a
  large refactor; the window resampling already gives an exact output size), texture replacement (needs the
  GSdx-compatible hash and naming from the specification team), D1 hardware raster (only if the laptop's GPU is the
  limit), frame skipping (owner).
- Checks: CTest 252/253 in both interlock modes (python_native_contracts, the pin); night race 3x frames equal 301's
  except a few wheel and road-marking pixels that vary run to run (a run with both new switches off varies the same);
  title identical to 287; 1x renders; windowed run equals the forced-size headless frame.

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0: CORE2 rewrite and the shared scale defect (IN-401..IN-404, candidate 285)

Branch `task/027-coregs2`. Owner baseline from 2026-10-28: a 1920 x 1080 window at 3x, 16:9, no ultrawide
(`build\hwr-play-scale.ps1`, `GT4_HW_CORE=2` by default). The core was rewritten on the reference model (CORE2,
`docs/hw-renderer-spec/CORE2-SPEC.md` and `CORE2-DESIGN.md`, `native/hw_gs/core2/`): one scaled image per target, GS
memory only through readbacks, EE uploads as dirty rectangles patched on the GPU, textures decoded on the GPU from a GPU
copy of GS memory, GT4's channel-shuffle tone as one pass (IN-401). Performance pass (IN-402): double-buffered command
recording, cached descriptor sets, fast host-to-local uploads; headless race 26.5 -> 18.8 ms per VBlank at 3x; the
owner measured stable 60 FPS in menus. The owner then saw the same defects as with the old core (ring notches in menus,
horizon stripes, random shadows), so the cause was in shared code: the front end dropped every primitive whose box holds
no pixel centre, which is right only at 1x (IN-403, found by black-box comparison with gt4-gs.exe final frames and
synthetic GS streams in `scripts/hw_blackbox/`). Fixed for both cores: the 6x menu ring now equals gt4-gs's, the grey
line across the road near the horizon is gone, race480p memory at 6x identical. Target heights round to page rows
(IN-404, no more menu-field overlap with the texture memory). Open: 480i deinterlace in CORE2, the car shadow,
frametime spikes at race start, CORE2 at 1x (HUD only), the remaining speed gap. Owner test 12 (candidate 285): passed
for picture faults ("zero bugs visuais"); open: race-start stutter and mid-race drops (the GS thread costs 20 ms per
VBlank at 3x, the GPU waits), no anti-aliasing, 480i deinterlace. Next steps in
[CORE2-ROADMAP](hw-renderer-spec/CORE2-ROADMAP.md). Roadmap phase A done in candidate 286 (IN-405): 480i deinterlace
and FXAA in core 2, with an adaptive rule that keeps GT4's fast-scrolling ticker clean as in gt4-gs. Owner test 13:
deinterlace clean like GSdx, but the race picture softer than GSdx's in the same 1080p window. Cause: the present
halved the 3x frame to 960 x 672 and stretched it back (IN-390 rule); fixed in candidate 287 (IN-406, both cores), one
bilinear reduction like the reference. Owner test 13b: sharpness solved. Phase B (deep performance pass, owner goal:
16.7 ms is the ceiling, beta gate a 2x i5-7200U/HD 620 laptop) started on a headless night B-Spec scene: palettes and
textures over drawn targets now read on the GPU, indexed textures keep their indices, submissions every 96 batches
(IN-407..IN-410, candidate 288): night race at 3x 20.8-26.4 -> 17.0-20.6 ms per VBlank, readbacks 6.9-8.7 -> 0.8-1.6 ms,
frames byte-identical. Owner test of 288: lighter at night, but the title backdrop broke after a GT Mode visit (GPU
reads kept a target alive past its ageing); fixed in candidate 289 (IN-411), night 17.8-22.2 ms per VBlank headless. Owner test of 289: title clean; night
race 57.0 VBlanks/s over 192 s (frame time p95 20.6 ms, p99 23.4 ms). Measured next: the GLM page copies cost only
0.3-0.5 ms per night VBlank, the CPU swizzle of EE uploads 2.3-2.8 ms; page-row runs cut it to 0.9 ms (IN-414,
candidate 290), and the new upload fixture found and fixed wrong T8H/T4HL/T4HH uploads. Most IN-411 store waits
were for nothing (GT4's streamed textures replace whole pages under its night render): skipped in candidate 291
(IN-415), GPU waits 2.3-3.4 -> 1.1-2.0 ms and GS thread 16-22 -> 14-19 ms per night VBlank. Owner test of 291:
night race 59.2 VBlanks/s over 190 s (p95 18.0, p99 19.6 ms), 60 FPS on the hood camera, no defects. Dirty
rectangles are now exact page by page and block by block for writes in the same layout (IN-416, candidate 292): the
remaining store waits went to about 0 ms on a long night race. CLUT loads over several or depth targets are read on
the GPU too (IN-417, candidate 293): GS thread 7.2-11.1 ms per VBlank on the long night race (292: 8.3-13.9).
Owner test of 293: 59.3 VBlanks/s, EE critical path 14.0 ms per frame. No allocation per batch and images reused by
size (IN-418, candidate 294): GS thread 5.5-8.9 ms per VBlank; the GPU side now shows up as the next limit. Owner
test of 294: 59.1 VBlanks/s, GPU-limited in the window (the GPU at 45 W of 180 W). GPU timestamps show a fixed cost
per command (1x 4.3-7.3 ms against 3x 6.6-9.1 ms); barriers only where a command depends on another (IN-419,
candidate 295) halved them, GPU time 3-13% less. Draw batches deferred into one render pass (IN-420, candidate
296): 4-8 render passes per VBlank instead of 106-312, GPU time 5-13% less; timestamps split the GPU time into
drawing 3.8-4.5 ms at 3x (scales with pixels, D1's target) and a fixed 1.4-3.8 ms of compute and transfer work.
D1 measured before building it (IN-421): the whole fragment stage is only 0.4-0.7 ms of GPU time at 3x, and the
draw-pass timestamps include overlapping compute; the GPU time is the chain of small dependent commands, the next
target. Textures over no target are now decoded from a CPU page window (IN-422, candidate 297): barriers down again,
GPU time 3-10% less. Every GPU-side step gives far less than its share; a low GPU clock at this partial load is the
next thing to check. All steps are tabled in `hw-renderer-spec/CORE2-PERF-LEDGER.md`. The owner's overlay confirmed
the GPU idles at a low clock (as with GSdx), so the frame is the EE critical path. The race-start stutters were found
with a per-VBlank spike log (IN-423): 40-160 image allocations per VBlank. Image memory now comes from 64 MiB blocks
(IN-424, candidate 298): race-start VBlanks over 20 ms 60 -> 2. Owner test of 298: race smooth at 60 FPS, frametime
still jittery in menus and slightly in the race. A GPU cost map (IN-425) showed the GPU has the power but is full of
gaps; with only two submissions in flight the CPU waited for it. Up to 8 submissions in flight and submissions every
32 batches (IN-426, candidate 299): Arcade B-Spec race VBlanks over 17 ms 59 -> 15, GPU waits cut to about a third.
Owner test of 299: 60 FPS, frametime nearly flat, fidelity perfect; phase B closed. Beta closing plan in CORE2-ROADMAP
(1x shows only the HUD, mipmapping, spec step 3 audit, the remaining spikes, a memory budget, CAS, present resampling,
the HD 620 laptop gate). After the beta, the 1.3.0-rc7 branch comes in and the PR goes to the code optimisation branch.
Not merged; no pins.

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0: scaled images sized to their slot (IN-384, parity plan Part A)

Branch `task/027-coregs2`. First half of item 1 of `docs/hw-renderer-spec/PARITY-PLAN.md`: every scaled presentation
image now holds only its slot's real extent (FBW * 64 wide, the loaded or drawn rows, rounded to a page), created
lazily and grown on demand with the old content copied. A draw, load or texture copy that reaches past the extent grows
the image first, so no pixel is clipped (`scaled_draws_clipped=0`). A texture taken from a resident slot copies only
the batch's sampled footprint (IN-380), so the 640 x 448 race frame no longer grows to its 1024 x 512 texture view.
Scaled image device memory on the 480p race capture: 64.1 MB at 2x, 243.1 MB at 4x, 541.4 MB at 6x, against 184.5 /
738.2 / 1,660.9 MB before (65-67% less; one 640 x 448 target is 41 MB instead of 151 MB at 6x). Gates unchanged:
CTest 245/245 in both interlock modes (new `hw_scale_target_extent`), the five memory captures byte-identical (menu
1,101 frames, race 121, car 121, night 121 with `fifo_hash=3a2fe617a174e7e7`, race480p 121), scaled memory equal to
1x and 0 low-detail presented frames at 2x/4x/6x, and the 06.3/IN-377/IN-379 fixtures unchanged. GPU busy on the
480p race replay (`--gpu-timing`, this build against candidate 273): 5.25/6.42/9.58/14.77 ms at 1/2/4/6x against
5.35/5.99/8.68/16.92; the 6x gain (about 13%, scaled pass 9.18 -> 8.04 ms) is the only one outside the run-to-run
spread, so the item is reported mainly as a memory win. Reported as `scaled_image_mb` on the `[hw] cost` line and on
the replay's `scale=` line with `scaled_image_grows` and `scaled_draws_clipped`. Next: the fast scaled raster itself
(an early-Z second pass with real attachments, tolerance only on the presented image). Not merged; no pins.

## TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0: tone-sequence strip executor (IN-383, parity plan item 2)

Branch `task/027-coregs2`. Owner requirement (2026-10-23): CoreGS 2.0 must reach GSdx's performance at the same
scale; item 2 of `docs/hw-renderer-spec/PARITY-PLAN.md` (tone-sequence HLE, memory-exact) landed first.
`hw_tone_strips.comp` writes the eight 8 x 32 decal T8 strips of one 64 x 32 frame-buffer page in one dispatch from
the GLM (index texel -> 07.4 CSM1 palette entry of the strip's quadrant -> CT24 RGB, alpha kept), replacing 135,399
strip batches with 16,940 page dispatches on the 480p race capture (140 per frame) and 118,580 palette loads held
(GPU CLUT loads 200,467 -> 98,827). All five memory captures are
byte-identical (menu 1,101 frames, race 121, car 121, night 121 with `fifo_hash=3a2fe617a174e7e7`, race480p 121),
`hw_tone_hle_exact` compares the dispatch against the batches (0 of 2 frames differ in 4 MiB, 0 pixels off the CPU
form of the rule, 0 alpha bytes changed) and CTest passes in both interlock modes. Replay CPU per frame: GS stream
9.95 -> 8.14 ms, batch 5.54 -> 4.28, translate 1.83 -> 0.97, execute 3.52 -> 2.89, CLUT 1.12 -> 0.75; GLM swizzles
33,938 -> 18,272. In the game (headless 480p race, same build with the HLE off and on): GS thread 13.4-15.6 ->
10.6-11.6 ms, render passes 341-347 -> 198-204, barriers 1,591-1,645 -> 1,437-1,474; GPU busy 7.19 -> 5.35 ms at 1x
and 19.01 -> 16.92 ms at 6x, which leaves the scaled pass (9.2 ms at 6x) as the next target (item 1 of the plan).
Switches `GT4_HW_TONE_HLE=0` / `--no-tone-hle` and `GT4_HW_VERIFY_SHUFFLE=1` / `--tone-verify`. Not merged; no pins.

## Local rc7 owner test candidate (2026-10-27)

Codex built an unpublished installer including the current Discord changes and verified extracted game and launcher hashes. Automated Rust tests passed; real Discord and gameplay remain untested. Important lifecycle and transport edge-case validation remains open; see docs/tasks/TASK-115-CODEX-LOCAL-KIT.md. This supersedes any earlier readiness claim.

## TASK-115 rc7 Discord Rich Presence review corrections (2026-10-27)

Superseded by the second review below; the earlier "corrected" wording was premature. The feature remains unreviewed by the owner and the Discord client is not yet validated.

## TASK-115 rc7 Discord Rich Presence second review (2026-10-27)

Second review corrections on branch `task/133-rc7-ra-controls`: `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`, safe completion waiting, protocol ack/error handling, generation fencing, non-blocking stop, and real Windows named-pipe tests (`windows_pipe_roundtrip`, `windows_pipe_read_timeout`) plus 6 manager tests, flow_audit and UI checks. Live Discord still pending owner authorization. Game Bar/GPU recognition remains future scope.

## TASK-133: rc7 scope reset to RetroAchievements and controller upgrades (2026-10-26)

Owner requested mapping only: published rc6 is the fixed program baseline, with RetroAchievements
from1.2.4 and controller-only changes from1.2.5. Frame skipping is excluded, preserved remotely
at15b7bf3 in task/082-render-skip (PR113 draft, report committed) for future CoreGS2.0 resumption.

Prepared task/133-rc7-ra-controls in C:/Antigravity/gt4-wt-133-rc7-ra-controls from exact tag
v1.3.0-rc6/5832222. Integration map: docs/tasks/TASK-133-RC7-RA-CONTROLS-INTEGRATION.md.
Main's1.2.5 program is the source reference, not a launcher/base replacement. RA is originalGT4-only
with a native and launcher SpecII guard; controller curves are shared by both games. Preserve modern
multi-game/portable paths, localization, channels and rc6 performance behavior. No wheel code.

Mapping/preparation only, no implementation/build/test run or agent dispatch. Installer and portable
rc7 will require new target builds/pins, both languages and draft checks. No public rc7 yet.

## rc6 performance, TASK-116 step 1 and TASK-117 (2026-10-25, `task/116-117-flare-perf`)

Implemented and tested headless, owner test pending; nothing merged or released.

- **TASK-116 step 1 (both targets' code, no new ELF):** in Performance mode only the 128-qword flare readback is answered
  locally with the previous reply (one frame old, never a zero table); `sync("download")` no longer drains the VU1 worker
  for it, the READ_FIFO is still posted in stream order (one record per readback, the night record counts equal the
  rc5 Performance-mode run), and every other readback keeps the blocking drain and the wait. Result (night race, headless
  1x): blocking drains 5,026 -> 29, the readback wait total 4,596.6 (Accurate) / 2,329.1 (rc5 Performance) -> 46.1 ms,
  4,997 of 4,998 flare replies from the cache. The Accurate run still hashes `c091716e3cb40d79` (release 1.3.0 pin). The
  P0 probe (`GT4_GS_READBACK_LOG=1`) answered the gate: in Performance mode gt4-gs returns stale real pixels, not zeros
  (139 distinct replies against 2,161), so the local answer can only be one frame late; the launcher help text of
  Performance Mode was corrected in both languages.
- **TASK-117 (GT4 v2.00 only): built, NOT shipped in rc6.** The derived ELF with four `jal` redirects and our own
  helpers in the zero padding (`scripts/flare_limits_elf_patch.py`, pinned table and verify mode), the new EE library
  profile `flare` (8 units differ from the slice208 library) and the host block at 0x7F10 are implemented and tested, but
  the switch-off identity gate failed: with every helper taking the original path, the night race still diverges from rc5
  from the first frame that draws flares (dumps from frame 10000; 27,246,609 records against 27,259,715). The rc6 v2.00
  build keeps the `aspect` library and the launcher sends no flare switch until the cause is found.
- **Checks:** CTest 46/46 and 47/47 (new `native_gs_readback_probe` and `native_flare_limits`), Python 697 tests OK
  (43 skipped) plus the new ELF patch test, `cargo test -p gt4l-core` 313 passed, MTVU verify 11,000 frames 0 mismatches.
  The Accurate identity vs rc5 holds (night stream hash `c091716e3cb40d79`). Next: the rc6 builds (v2.00 on the `aspect`
  library, Spec II with step 1 only), the pins and the draft.

## rc5 Settings open at once, TASK-114 item 8 (2026-10-24, `task/101-multi-game`, 1.3.0-rc5)

Implemented, owner test pending; nothing merged or released. The graphics cards are probed once and kept (Play refreshes
them once), and the Settings tabs open from memory: the settings table, About info, the launcher version list, the Games list and the Saves and Replays lists are read
when the home screen is up and drawn again only when something changed. "Loading settings..." appears only with no data
and after 300 ms. A tab's rows fade in once. Probes per action (code paths): start 1 (unchanged), open a Settings tab 2 to 0,
save a setting 2 to 0, Play 3 to 1, export logs 1 to 0. Checks: `cargo test --workspace` 556 passed, 0 failed, 5 ignored;
focus-check en-US 195/195 and pt-BR 202/202; nav-test 150/150 (headless Edge, own server stopped). The monitor list stays
live (not measured as slow). Not verified: the animation's feel on the owner's machine.

## rc5 polish, TASK-114 items 5-7 (2026-10-24, `task/101-multi-game`)

Implemented, owner test pending; nothing merged or released. Settings > Games names the version (Spec II v1.10) and shows
the variant and size; the button is Update; the setup steps say what they do (recognised, copying and checking, final
check); the launcher is denser on every page (CSS in app.css, changed in place); the launcher icon is the emblem on a white
rounded square. Checks: `cargo test --workspace` 550 passed, 0 failed, 5 ignored; focus-check en-US 193/193 and pt-BR
200/200; nav-test 150/150 (headless Edge, own server stopped). Screenshots pt-BR in `O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice292-shots\`
(each page at 1280x720 and 1440x900). The launcher executable with the new icon is built at the next release build.

## rc5 hotfixes, TASK-114 (2026-10-23, `task/101-multi-game`)

Implemented, owner test pending: setup identifies the disc before copying and the first-run page is generic; the copy bar ends
full; the GPU list merges identical integrated entries and the log shows the raw entries; the 1.3.0 intro is looked up by base
version and hardened (the black window cause is not confirmed). Details in TASKS (TASK-114) and the journal.

## rc5 TASK-109: update channels and version picker (2026-10-23, `task/101-multi-game`, 1.3.0-rc5)

Implemented, owner test pending; nothing merged or released. Settings > General has Channel (Stable or Beta) and Version
(list read from GitHub on open, refresh button). The launcher version carries `-rcN` (`build-release.ps1 -Label rc5`).
Beta offers candidates and stable releases by version, Stable never offers a candidate and never downgrades, the picker lists
1.3.0-rc5 and newer, and an older target gets the strong downgrade warning. The real GitHub fetch and a real install of a
chosen version are not verified here (fake release JSON only).

Checks: `cargo test --workspace` 544 passed, 0 failed (`a_1_2_x_install_moves_into_games_gt4_at_the_first_start` failed
in 2 of 5 full runs and passed alone and in later runs: a timing flake on a shared machine; the cause was not
investigated and the code touched does not feed it); focus-check en-US 183/183 and pt-BR 190/190, nav-test 150/150 (headless Edge, server
stopped); Python `make_portable_zip` 9 tests OK. No installer built, no game launched.

## rc4 (2026-10-23, `task/101-multi-game`, 1.3.0-rc4): owner test 1 fixes and TASK-111, TASK-112

Implemented in the working tree, owner test pending; nothing merged or released. Items:
- **Saves per game (TASK-101 item 1).** Spec II's game data is `BASCUS-97436GAMEDATA` (the rc3 harvest dropped it).
  `gt4saves::SaveNames` per game; each library takes its own items; a mixed card is split by game; the import routes by
  name. The Spec II replay prefix `BASCUS-97436` is not verified with a real replay.
- **One Saves list (item 2).** Both games in one list, tagged; actions go to the item's game; New save asks the game when
  two are installed. Replays stay per game.
- **GPU list (item 3).** Vulkan and DXGI merged per physical card (LUID, else PCI ids, else name). The Vulkan probe now reads
  deviceID, driverVersion and the LUID; checked on this machine (AMD RX 9060 XT, LUID read). NVIDIA not checked.
- **Copy bar (item 4).** The bar uses the same byte total as its figure. The owner's exact case was not reproduced here.
- **Launcher logs (TASK-112).** One file per launch with INFO/WARN/ERROR, the last 20 kept, `latest.log` with the earlier
  errors, the 1.2.x log migrated once, game session folders capped at 20; About > Open latest log.
- **Export logs (TASK-111).** About and the crash / lost-card dialog; the zip with masked user names and paths; the system
  report; Open the folder and Report a problem (named link `report_problem`).

Checks: `cargo test --workspace` 519 passed, 0 failed; focus-check en-US 160/160 and pt-BR 167/167, nav-test 150/150
(headless Edge, server stopped); `cargo check --features visual-check` OK; the language check (keys, placeholders, bullets)
passes, with three identical pt-BR values that are product or language names. No game launched. Not done: owner tests
(Spec II save recovery, export, the crash dialog), the installer build (not asked).



## TASK-108 launcher: automatic graphics API and card; game programs gt4.exe and gt4-spec2.exe (2026-10-23, on `task/101-multi-game`, release 1.3.0)

Implemented in the working tree, not committed until the checks below pass; owner test pending. Graphics API has an
Automatic choice (default; Vulkan when the chosen card reports Vulkan 1.2, else Direct3D 11), resolved at every start and
Play. A Graphics card row picks the card (Automatic = discrete before integrated, then most video memory); its name goes
to the game's Adapter key (written by the launcher under `[EmuCore/GS]`). Explicit Vulkan without Vulkan 1.2 runs with
Direct3D 11, with a note in both languages. The game programs ship as `gt4.exe` and `gt4-spec2.exe` (installer, portable zip,
game folder, launcher, process detection for both names). Build output names unchanged; pins unchanged. Planned, no code: TASK-109
(update channels, 1.3.1) and TASK-110 (controller tuning, 1.3.1). Checks: `cargo test --workspace` 494 passed, 0 failed,
4 ignored; focus-check en-US 158/158 and pt-BR 165/165, nav-test 150/150 (headless Edge); `test_gs_settings` OK (72),
`test_make_distribution` OK (5), `test_make_portable_zip` OK (7), `test_gs_osd` / `test_gs_window` / `test_gs_nojit` OK.
`test_portable_install` skipped (no `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` here). Open: owner test on NVIDIA + integrated, and on a machine
without Vulkan 1.2; the installer is built by the main agent.

## TASK-105 integrated GPUs: lighter default and GPU-lost message (#89) (2026-10-23, on `task/101-multi-game`, release 1.3.0)

Implemented, not merged; owner in-game test pending. Issue #89 (Intel UHD only, 1440 x 900): the default Render scale gave 3x
and GSdx lost the device. On an integrated GPU the untouched default scale (100%) now plays at 1x (640 x 448); a changed scale
keeps its choice; discrete machines are unchanged. A session that ends with GSdx's device-lost text in `game.log` shows a plain
message in en-US and pt-BR. Saves dates follow the interface language. Checks: `cargo test --workspace` 487 passed, 0 failed,
4 ignored; focus-check 158/158 (en-US) and 165/165 (pt-BR), nav-test 150/150. Open: owner test on an integrated GPU; the real
device-lost line in `game.log` is not yet confirmed.

## TASK-104 launcher saves: crash-proof card import, New save, Export, Rename (2026-10-23, on `task/101-multi-game`, release 1.3.0)

Implemented, not merged; owner test pending. Issue #86 (importing a PCSX2 `Mcd001.ps2` closed the launcher): the card reader
now reads the layout from the superblock (8 to 64 MB, with or without spare bytes), bounds directory depth (8), visits each
directory once, checks every length before allocating, and the import runs under a panic guard that logs the file name and
size. The Saves page gets New save (confirmed; the current save is kept as a new slot), Export of the active save as `.psu`
and Rename (40 characters, `name.txt` beside the save). Checks: `cargo test --workspace` 474 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored;
focus-check 158/158 (en-US) and 165/165 (pt-BR), nav-test 150/150. Open: owner test with a real card and in-game New save.

## TASK-103 Graphics API for GSdx (2026-10-23, on `task/101-multi-game`, release 1.3.0)

Implemented, not merged; owner in-game test pending. Settings > Graphics offers "Graphics API (GSdx)" (table row `graphics_api`,
`[EmuCore/GS] Renderer` = 14, 15, 3): Vulkan (recommended, default), Direct3D 12 (recommended), Direct3D 11 (older PCs). The
engine setting stays `renderer`. A missing or unknown value falls back to Vulkan. Checks: `cargo test --workspace` 453 passed,
Python `test_gs_*` 168 OK, focus-check 151/151 (en-US) and 158/158 (pt-BR), nav-test 150/150; screenshots in
`O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice280-shots`. Open: owner test on Direct3D 11 and 12 against Vulkan.

## TASK-102 launcher language: en-US and pt-BR (2026-10-23, on `task/101-multi-game`)

Implemented, not merged; owner test pending. The launcher follows the Windows language (Auto); Settings > General > Language
changes it at once. The texts are data: `launcher/crates/gt4l-tauri/ui/locales/<tag>.json` and `index.json` (the UI and the
launcher's own messages under `rust.*`, generated into a table by `gt4l-core/build.rs`), the release notes under
`docs/release-notes/launcher/<tag>/`. Adding a language is documented in `docs/TRANSLATING.md`. The CSP allows the page to
read its own locale files (`connect-src 'self'`). Checks: focus-check 151 of 151 (en-US) and 158 of 158 (pt-BR), nav-test
150 of 150, `cargo test --workspace` 450 passed. Gaps: the PCSX2 GS rows that are not in the UI keys show English, and the
XInput and key names in the controller chips stay English.

## TASK-098 portable build and TASK-097 self-sufficient game (2026-10-23, slice 278, on `task/101-multi-game`)

Release 1.3.0 (both moved from 1.2.4). **TASK-098:** a second launcher build from one source (Cargo feature `portable`):
`user\` and `data\` beside `GT4Recomp.exe`, no registry value and no system folder (the web view profile goes to
`data\launcher-webview`), per-folder single-instance lock, self-update from `GT4Recomp-<version>-portable.zip` by a
rename swap that never touches `user\` or `data\` and rolls back on failure; `scripts/make_portable_zip.py` and
`build-release.ps1 -Portable`. `cargo test --workspace` 431 passed in each build. **TASK-097:** the game executable starts
on its own (no ELF argument): paths from `<install>\game\gt4vulkan*.exe`, built-in defaults (GSdx, 480p, 16:9 hold,
automatic ultrawide, fullscreen, vsync), the launcher's `game.ini` and `gt4-gs.ini` from the user config folder, and a
native message that says to open the launcher once when a piece is missing. With an ELF argument (the launcher, the
harnesses) nothing changed: headless identity against slice268 is exact (see docs/BUILD.md "Slice 278"). Not tested by the
owner yet: the portable zip on a real PC (none was built), a direct double click of the game.

## TASK-101 multi-game launcher on branch (2026-10-23)

Branch `task/101-multi-game` (from `task/100-spec2` and main). The launcher now holds two games: a game table, per-game
disc copy, prepared files, runtime card, saves and replays (`games\<id>`), identification by serial and the pinned
executable hash (Spec II 1.10, the PT-BR image and unknown images with the known executable accepted; the unmodified
Public Beta and other SCUS-97436 programs refused), the Spec II setup (Rust port of the ELF patch, byte-identical to
`scripts/spec2_elf_patch.py`), per-game launch, the 1.2.x to `games\gt4` migration and the UI (selector, Install, Settings >
Games). `cargo test --workspace`: 405 passed, 4 ignored; the dev mock checks pass headless (121 DOM checks, 150 model
checks). Open: the look on a real window, the authors' logo and names, the installer build. Plan progress:
[MULTI-GAME-LAUNCHER-PLAN](MULTI-GAME-LAUNCHER-PLAN.md).

## Release 1.3.0 candidate built (2026-10-23, NOT published)

Branch `task/101-multi-game`, merges `63c110e` (origin/main `db5c559`) and `b8a6b5f` (origin/task/100-spec2
`9206af5`, S8c). Version 1.3.0 in `launcher/Cargo.toml`, the workspace crates of `Cargo.lock`, `tauri.conf.json` and
the installer default. No PR, merge, tag or GitHub release yet (owner approval first).

- **Two game builds, fresh slices:** v2.00 `private/slice279-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe` 97,377,792 bytes, sha256
  `9dccb5a4…` (pin `inputs/slice279-pcsx2.json`); Spec II `private/slice280-build/build/gt4vulkan-spec2.exe`
  104,612,352 bytes, sha256 `174e7adf…` (pin `inputs/slice280-spec2.json`). The Spec II pin records the S7b IOP
  runtime (`slice276`), the S8b guard (`slice277`) and the S8c EE library (`slice278`); the v2.00 pin keeps the
  slice262 capsules and the slice217 aspect library. `PERF_PROFILES['pcsx2']` now points at slice279 (slice268 kept
  as `pcsx2-slice268`); `SPEC2_RELEASE` holds slice280. The release gt4-gs pin moved to **1.2.1**
  (`private/slice281-gt4gs-121`, `gt4-gs.exe` 11,347,456 bytes `887f5bf9…`, zip 13,025,171 bytes `7eb7e4a3…`).
- **Release notes written before the build:** `docs/release-notes/1.3.0.md` (full), launcher `1.3.0.md` (en-US) and
  `pt-BR/1.3.0.md`. They cover Spec II 1.10 and same-executable variants side by side, separate per-game saves, the
  multi-game launcher, What's new, automatic language, the Graphics API choice, the portable build and the standalone
  game executable. **Owner decision 2026-10-23: no permission from the Spec II authors is needed**; they are credited
  by name in the full notes, the About page (both languages) and README, and the notes state that GT4Recomp ships no
  Spec II files (the player supplies the disc image).
- **Distribution/installer/portable:** `GAME_DIR` `private/slice282-dist-130` (both exes, shaders, CRT DLLs, SDL3,
  licences, MANIFEST; 24 files). Launcher release `GT4Recomp.exe` 17,038,336 bytes `69530dfa…` and portable
  `GT4Recomp.exe` 16,973,824 bytes `a1a0ed0d…`, both without user/build paths. Installer
  `private/release-130-out/GT4Recomp-Setup-1.3.0.exe` 51,373,344 bytes sha256 `d1569b35…`; 7-Zip extraction compared
  24 files with their sources (0 differences). Portable `GT4Recomp-1.3.0-portable.zip` 83,032,500 bytes sha256
  `bfa3a08a…`; `SHA256SUMS` lists both.
- **Checks:** CTest 45/45 in both builds; Python 694 OK (42 skipped with the v2.00 build, 56 with Spec II);
  `cargo test --workspace` clean (new relocate retry test); launcher focus-check en-US 151/151 and pt-BR 158/158,
  nav-test 150/150 in headless Edge; the launcher's Rust Spec II derivation is byte-identical to
  `scripts/spec2_elf_patch.py` (`36f60b1a…`) and both real-image tests pass. **v2.00 identity against slice268 is
  exact** in menus/day/night dumps and stream hashes (`463d455c…`/`1ccb97c5…`, `992f1ac9…`/`0c79dcf5…`,
  `c57e7d03…`/`c091716e…`).
- **Flaky migration test:** a scanner/indexer can hold a freshly written file, so the rename failed transiently. The
  move now retries sharing/lock/access-denied errors five times (20-100 ms apart) before reporting a failure; the
  test policy is covered by `only_scanner_and_lock_errors_are_retried`. The migration test passed 10/10 in isolation
  and in the full workspace run.
- **Owner test checklist** (not yet done): fresh install; update over 1.2.3 with the owner data in `%APPDATA%`
  kept; Spec II install from the ISO; Spec II GT mode and a license DEMO watched (log must show `[license-guard]`);
  Options menu; saves separate both ways; Graphics API Vulkan/D3D12/D3D11 in game; language switch; standalone exe;
  portable build on another PC.

## TASK-100 Spec II on branch (2026-10-22, S1 done)

Branch `task/100-spec2`. The owner supplied the Public Beta ISO and it is confirmed as the exact base of Spec II 1.10
(the community `.xdelta` decodes to the owner's Spec II ISO byte for byte). The beta's game image was rebuilt from its
encrypted `CORE.GT4` (Salsa20/20, key `PolyphonyDigital`, CRC-32C trailer) into
`private/slice271-spec2-beta-elf` (ELF `2e5621ed…`), which makes the static patch set measurable: Spec II changes
**one word** of the beta's own code (`0x001001E8`, a trampoline into the plugin) and adds the `.plugin` segment at
`0x0068A480` (0x2CCC bytes) over zero-filled data; everything else is byte-identical. All other behaviour changes are
written at boot by the injector: 35 word stores (18 text, 17 data), unconditional, recovered by executing the init on
an EE-RAM image. Next: S3 (target-aware host hooks, v2.00 byte-identical), S5/S6, S2/S4. Report:
[SPEC2-PATCHES](SPEC2-PATCHES.md). Nothing merged.

S3 is done: `native/game_target.hpp` holds every guest address of the host hooks per target; v2.00 keeps the release
values, and a target without an address disables the hook (one log line) with the capsule text unchanged. CTest 42/42
(new `native_game_target`); the Python suite passes except the release-pin distribution test, which any rebuilt
executable fails. Headless identity against the 1.2.3 build (slice268) is exact in all three scenes, dumps and GS
stream hashes (menus `463d455c…`/`1ccb97c5…`, day `992f1ac9…`/`0c79dcf5…`, night `c57e7d03…`/`c091716e…`), on the
final code state. S5: the VU1 blob decrypts to the v2.00 image (`ae6b6cb3…`), so the AOT table carries over; the VU0
upload differs (0x920 vs 0xA80, 1,050 bytes) and uses the counted interpreter fallback. S6: 35 IOP files mapped with
per-module policy (6 new, inherited from the beta lineage).

S2 is done too: `scripts/spec2_elf_patch.py` applies the 35 injector stores to `SCUS_974.36` from the ISO and writes
`private/slice272-spec2-elf` (`10a794df…`; `--revert` reproduces the original `db08421b…`). The trampoline at
`0x001001E8` is deliberately kept: the plugin's init calls the beta's boot initialiser and one more game function, so
only the stores are reproduced ahead of time. Pins `inputs/spec2-iso.json` and `inputs/spec2-elf.json`. S4 (its own
translated library and executable) and S7b (first boot) are next.

The Spec II translation now runs: `scripts/spec2_ee_generate.py` feeds the derived ELF to the pinned donor translator
(plain-ELF path, no CORE) and produces 346 units (1,286,297 instructions, 17,061 functions, 148,522 entries, 2 rejected
seeds), pinned in `inputs/spec2-ee-generated.json`; the generated C++ stays in scratch. Still open: the Spec II library
and its own executable (a second CMake profile), then the first boot.

S4 is now built: `-DGT4_TARGET=spec2 -DGT4_EE_PROFILE=spec2` links the Spec II library
(`private/slice274-spec2-ee-producer/game-build/ps2game.lib`, `5e483768…`) into `gt4vulkan-spec2.exe`, with v2.00
untouched. Two S7b fixes landed on the way: the plugin PT_LOAD sits inside the data PT_LOAD, so the derived ELF now
splits the data segment around the plugin (the translator otherwise read zeros for it), and 12 plugin entry seeds
cover the plugin's own pointer tables.

**S7b is unblocked, and the Spec II target boots to the menus and into a race (2026-10-23).** The stall was the FILEIO
protocol generation: the Spec II disc reboots the IOP with `DNAS310.IMG` instead of `IOPRP300.IMG`, and the donor
selected its asynchronous FILEIO server (the one that answers `devctl`, method 23, with the SIF packet `0x80000011`)
only for a path containing `IOPRP`. On the synchronous fallback the game's fileio thread waited forever on its
completion semaphore. The reboot image itself needs no loading: DNAS310.IMG is the same romdir as IOPRP300.IMG with
the same 16 Sony system modules in the same order, all served as HLE (`docs/IOP-MAP.md`, `inputs/spec2-dnas310.json`).
Fix: capsule `private/slice276-spec2-iop-runtime` (`--spec2-iop`, `scripts/spec2_iop_overlay.inc` +
`native/spec2_iop.hpp`); v2.00 keeps its capsule and is unchanged. Headless evidence: 4,200 menu frames with 1.8 M
primitives, the language menu, the main menu, Arcade Mode, track and car selection, and a 21,000-frame race at Costa
di Amalfi (169.7 M primitives, HUD and lap timer), with no "no translated code". CTest 43/43 in the Spec II build; the
Python suite passes with the Spec II build (668 tests) and keeps only the expected release-pin failure with the v2.00
build. v2.00 identity re-run: menus `463d455c…`/`1ccb97c5…`, day `992f1ac9…`/`0c79dcf5…`, night
`c57e7d03…`/`c091716e…`, all equal to the 1.2.3 build.

**S7c is done: Spec II runs on GSdx**, the shipping external PCSX2 GS process (`GT4_RENDERER=pcsx2`). Headless:
menus 4,200 frames, a Costa di Amalfi race (21,000 frames, 12 readbacks), a night race at C.S. Route 5 (2,928
readbacks, one 483 ms outlier), 3x upscale (1920x1440 dumps) and the owner's `!_HD HUD & UI` texture pack
(`[Folders] Textures` + `LoadTextureReplacements`; needs gt4-gs 1.2.1, the repo pin is 1.0.1), all clean (protocol
1.2, no stream errors or back-pressure stalls). The GT4 display crop is a fixed gt4-gs constant (`{0,0,1,2}`) that
logs for both games; the game still announces the v2.00 serial SCUS-97328 in the GS handshake and gt4-gs has no
SCUS-97436 GameDB entry (recorded for S8/S9). `scripts/frame_cost_headless.py` gained `--exe/--elf/--iso/--press/
--textures/--gs-sha256` with the v2.00 gate defaults unchanged.

**S8 is done for the main hooks (2026-10-23).** The Spec II table now has the option chain (owner `0x664EDC`, option
`+0x680`, wide flag `+0x14`, record `+0x24` with width/height at `+0xC`/`+0x10`, presets `0x664E20/50/80/B0`,
published wide word `0x6655A0`, race display index `+0x1718`), `RaceBase::initMonitor` `0x26BDB0` with the camera
return label `0x26BE60`, `RaceDisplay::render` `0x1C5040` and the HUD matrix at `+0x70`. Values were found from the
v2.00 code shapes in the derived ELF and confirmed with a runtime RAM dump of the Spec II menus. New fixture
`native_spec2_hooks` asserts every value and the write rules in synthetic RAM; a headless GSdx race at 21:9 shows the
camera matrix scaled (`x 0.761905`), the first `RaceDisplay::render`, the centred HUD canvas and the fill policy. The
16:9 hold finds the settled owner (the game already boots 16:9, so it writes nothing); the 480p hold is a
`window.cpp` VBlank hook, so headless runs cover its Spec II rule through the fixture only. Still open, rows left 0
and the hook logs once: the display request struct (photo mode), the license demo guard (Spec II has the feature; the
loaders are not mapped) and the shape observer. CTest 44/44 in the Spec II build; Python 671 tests clean on the Spec
II build (51 skipped) and only the expected release-pin failure on v2.00; v2.00 identity against slice268 exact.
Next: S9 (launcher, installer, credits).

**S8b is done: the license demo guard is on for Spec II (2026-10-23).** `kSpec2Hooks` now has loadDemoInputs
`0x2012C8` (RaceSolitaire vtable `0x6B3130 + 0x510`, the same virtual v2.00 has at `+0x4D8`), loaders
`0x10CA18`/`0x10CBA8` with return labels `0x10CB54`/`0x10CCE4` (each calls the `license/%s` helper `0x1A8BE8` and
makes one vtable call), `Manager::load` `0x207AA0`, the game CRC-32 table `0x731DB0`, the Manager add `0x1A24` and a
loader body pointer shift `0x80`. The cipher is unchanged (`0x459E90`, FT at `0x667048`, T8 at `0x731C98`); the Spec
II volume's 256 `replay/license` demos are the retail files (171 shared with v2.00, 170 bodies byte-identical) and
CRC-confirmed plaintexts keep the single-Recorder stream at body `+0x1AA4`, so the layout and CRC rule are unchanged
and the code's `0x1A24` add applies to a pointer 0x80 into the body (High confidence; not observed at runtime).
The guard now evaluates the header's body and writes `n = 0xFFFFFFFF` at `a1 + manager_add`, exactly where the
virtual reads (a static assert keeps add + shift = 0x1AA4); the overlay was re-derived into the fresh capsule
`private/slice277-license-guard-runtime` (slice262 profile), pinned in `inputs/slice277-license-guard-runtime.json`,
and CMake accepts slice27x guard capsules (v2.00 keeps slice262). Oracle on the Spec II set with our FPU: 0/256 CRC
passes, 114 sane layouts, **142 demos guarded**. Headless license test not reachable (GT mode needs game data; the
seed cards have none), so the owner run remains the gate; its log prints `demo`, `body` and `manager`. CTest 44/44 and
Python 675 OK (51 skipped) on the Spec II build, including the overlay harness compiled for `GT4_TARGET_SPEC2`;
v2.00 identity against slice268 exact in all three scenes (dumps `463d455c.`/`992f1ac9.`/`c57e7d03.`, streams
`1ccb97c5.`/`0c79dcf5.`/`c091716e.`). Next: S9 (launcher, installer, credits).

**S8c fixes the owner's Options-menu halt and widens the Spec II entry seeds (2026-10-23).** The owner's first Spec
II test halted twice opening Options (`missing code at 0x003CA690`, ra `0x0050D1B0`). The callback is built by the
Options page itself: `lui s0,0x003D` at `0x003CC8EC` + `addiu s0,s0,-22896` 53 instructions later, stored in the
descriptor; the translator's `luipair` window is 3 instructions and no dataword points at it, so it never became an
entry. New `scripts/spec2_entry_seeds.py` seeds the missing classes (wide `luipair` window 64, stack-frame
fallthrough, executable-segment literal code entries) as a 1,299-entry delta; the regenerated translation has
1,332,727 instructions, 18,597 functions and 153,474 entries, and the new library
`private/slice278-spec2-ee-producer/game-build/ps2game.lib` (80,229,124 bytes, `9a94c3ed.`) is pinned in
`inputs/spec2-ee-libraries.json` / `inputs/spec2-ee-generated.json` (CMake accepts only slice278 for the spec2
profile). After the reseed the sweep finds no real missing entries in the luipair/fallthrough/dataword/executable
classes (only plugin strings/zeros remain). Headless: the old exe reproduces the halt after 11,159 frames; the new
exe opens Options and every submenu (Race, Replay, Screen 16:9, Picture Quality, Sound, Arcade Mode, LAN Connection
Settings, Photo Lab), Replay Theater, Save Game, Credits, GT Mode and the Arcade menu with no halt. The harness gained
`--card` for an owner-card copy; a license demo was still not reached headless (the mod's "Spec II Settings" dialog
blocks the GT map in the current schedule), so the `[license-guard]` confirmation stays with the owner. New executable:
`O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s7d-build\build\gt4vulkan-spec2.exe`, 104,475,136 bytes, sha256 `301bbb4a.`. CTest 44/44
and Python 678 OK (51 skipped) on the Spec II build; v2.00 identity against slice268 unchanged (menus/day/night dumps
and stream hashes). Next: S9 (launcher, installer, credits).

## Release 1.2.3 published (2026-10-22, hotfix: TASK-092, 093, 094, 096)

Game slice268 (the 1.2.2 game plus the CoreGS 1.1 crash fix and the MTVU test-switch fixes); launcher 1.2.3: GSdx only
(CoreGS 1.1 removed from the launcher, CoreGS 2.0 shown as coming soon), textures straight in `data\Textures` with
gt4-gs 1.2.1 (published earlier the same day), desktop shortcut from the installer. Installer
`GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.3.exe` (sha256 `475defe07926f6e41e8f8c91fd4bb3565a17d6aac92f5c8fc857d0a143530a0b`). Owner tested.
Notes: [1.2.3](release-notes/1.2.3.md). Next: 1.2.4 (TASK-097, 098, 099), 1.3.0 wheels, 1.4.0 Spec II.

## TASK-096 on branch (2026-10-22, for launcher 1.2.3, waiting for the owner test)

Branch `task/096-remove-coregs11`: the launcher no longer starts CoreGS 1.1. GSdx is the only renderer; a missing or
unverified GSdx stops Play with a message that names the log folder, and a GSdx restart request does the same. A stored
CoreGS 1.1 choice becomes GSdx in settings schema 7. CoreGS 1.1 stays in the game executable, unused by the launcher.
Not merged.

## TASK-093 on branch (2026-10-22, waiting for gt4-gs 1.2.1 and the owner test)

Branch `task/093-textures-root`: custom textures go straight in `data\Textures`; the launcher no longer creates
`replacements`, `RENDERER_MINIMUM` is gt4-gs 1.2.1, and an old `replacements` folder is flattened into `Textures` at
start once gt4-gs 1.2.1 is in use (`gt4l-core/src/textures.rs`). Workspace tests and the Python gs suite pass. Not
merged; planned for release 1.2.3 with TASK-092.

## MTVU test switches fixed (2026-10-22, TASK-092, branch `task/092-mtvu-test-switches`, waiting for release)

Slice264 (not the player path): `GT4_MTVU=0` and `GT4_MTVU_VERIFY=1` in pcsx2 mode work again. One condition,
`vblank_journal_active()` (journal on, worker on, verify off), decides the GS client VSYNC deferral and the VBlank
drain. The doorbell handshake uses seq_cst. Default path identical to slice262 (dump hashes and GS stream hash equal in
menus and night). Open: two `gt4vulkan.exe` pin tests still point at slice262's executable; a slice264 pin set needs an
owner decision. Details: BUILD.md "Slice 264".

## Release 1.2.2 published (2026-10-22, TASK-084, PR #82)

Launcher 1.2.1 at version 1.2.2 with the TASK-084 game build slice262 (owner tested and approved). Installer
`GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.2.exe` (28,862,899 bytes, sha256 `6ecab016197fa2869261f9d3fd4ca099cb974b576ff05e1dc7b284847628a35f`),
gt4-gs unchanged (1.2.0). Release notes: [1.2.2](release-notes/1.2.2.md). Follow-up: TASK-092 (MTVU test switches).

## Frame cost, runtime side (2026-10-22, TASK-084, DONE, branch `task/084-frame-cost-122`, owner approved)

The study's missing F8 instrumentation and items 2-4 are implemented; item 1 (deferred flare readback) stays out
by owner decision (readback work belongs to CoreGS 2.0). New runtime switches, all on by default:
`GT4_MTVU_CHAIN` (one MTVU job per VIF1 DMA chain), `GT4_GIF_FASTPATH` (no second GS stream walk),
`GT4_MTVU_VBLANK_JOURNAL` (VBlank as a journal entry in pcsx2 mode). Release-candidate build `slice262`
(pin `docs/inputs/slice262-pcsx2.json`; mode `pcsx2` points at it for the owner test). Checks: CTest 40/40; the
Python suite with the new `tests/python/test_frame_cost.py`; menus 41/41, day race 15/15 and night race 15/15 frame
dumps and the GS stream session hash identical to release 1.2.0 (slice240); `GT4_MTVU_VERIFY=1` with 0
mismatches in 4,200 frames. **Owner in-game test 2026-10-22 approved** (session
`session-20261022-163408-808184`, 0 late frames in every scene, picture unchanged): showroom critical path
6.06 ms/frame with 35.8 VIF jobs/frame, Nordschleife TT 480p 6.13 with 58.6, night race 9.97 with 80.4 (the
TASK-041 owner baseline was 11.8). The night-race download wait and the GS readbacks stay out of scope
(TASK-041 Performance Mode and CoreGS 2.0). Numbers, build recipe and the owner F7/F8 checklist:
[BUILD slice 260/262](BUILD.md). PR into main opened; the reviewer merges main (launcher 1.2.1) and builds
release 1.2.2.

## Release 1.2.1 prepared (2026-10-22, TASK-091, branch `task/091-install-layout-121`, waiting for owner test)

Owner decisions: per-machine install in `C:\Program Files\GT4Recomp` (administrator rights, any folder allowed); the
large data in `<install>\data` (found relative to `GT4Recomp.exe`, so the folder is portable; Users get Modify on that
folder only); settings, controls, saves and replays per Windows user in `%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp`. The launcher moves the
1.2.0 files at its first start (user data copied and checked, the Documents folder renamed with a README; game files
renamed or copied, checked and then removed) and removes the old per-user program install; the self-update starts the
elevated setup through the UAC prompt. Game build and gt4-gs unchanged (slice240, gt4-gs 1.2.0). Owner test installer
`private/slice250-installer/GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.1-test.exe` (28,838,764 bytes, sha256
`333d72bcbc05066f020244b32c1c0a1e890da635451f757586498c1bf7316fb6`), not run on this PC; nothing published. Details:
[BUILD slice 250](BUILD.md), [TASK-091](../TASKS.md), [release notes 1.2.1](release-notes/1.2.1.md), journal 2026-10-22.

## Release 1.2.0 prepared (2026-10-21, TASK-088, branch `task/088-custom-textures-120`, waiting for owner test)

Owner decisions: custom textures in gt4-gs (load only; folder `Documents\Gran Turismo 4\Textures`, Graphics option
"Load custom textures" on by default, Advanced "Precache custom textures" off, "Open textures folder"), the bottom crop
of 2 native rows, and a black window from the first frame. Versions: GT4Recomp 1.2.0 and gt4-gs 1.2.0 (the launcher needs
gt4-gs 1.2.0 at least). Settings schema 6 (backup kept). Game build `slice240` (`docs/inputs/slice240-pcsx2.json`).
Local artifacts, nothing published: gt4-gs package `private/slice240-gt4gs-120/gt4-gs-1.2.0-windows-x64.zip`
(branch `gt4gs/textures-1.2.0`, commit `c9dc54e93`); owner installer `private/slice240-installer/GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.0-test.exe`
(28,765,729 bytes, sha256 `0edcfefe3a143c180bdc1255357780d414aac9cd1e60bf65fc6b583648187ec7`); helper
`private/slice240-gt4gs-120/install-gt4gs-1.2.0-test.ps1` for the local gt4-gs. Details: [BUILD slice 240](BUILD.md),
[TASK-088](../TASKS.md), journal 2026-10-21. Owner test pending: white start, crop, the texture folder with a real pack.
## CoreGS independent launcher candidate (2026-10-21, TASK-089)

Branch `task/089-coregs-independent-launcher`, baseline main `6422988`. Selecting CoreGS 1.1 now
skips the optional PCSX2 GS installer during setup, automatic package repair at startup and background
renderer release queries. Launcher updates and explicit manual renderer updates remain available.
Play also avoids inspecting an unused external renderer executable. Synthetic setup/launch and injected
release-request controls pass: the full Rust launcher workspace passes on Windows, including 53 Tauri tests
(one real-disc flow ignored). Maintainer launcher acceptance remains pending. Branch audit and limits:
[renderer independence](reverse-engineering/renderer-independence-2026-10-21.md).
No renderer implementation, game executable, input pins or saves changed. CoreGS 2.0 is not enabled by this change.
Contribution: [PR #72](https://github.com/moesuito/gt4-staticrecomp/pull/72), from the
`JulioHeroZ/gt4-staticrecomp` fork; implementation commit `aa51f2a`. Awaiting maintainer acceptance.


## Launcher self-update fixed (2026-10-21, TASK-085, branch `task/085-launcher-self-update`)

Owner report: launcher 1.0.0 offered 1.1.0, closed after the download and installed nothing. The setup joined the
launcher's kill-on-close job and died with it; now it leaves the job (`CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`, Explorer fallback).
Release v1.1.0 went back to draft (0 installer downloads) and was rebuilt: launcher GT4Recomp.exe 16,010,752 bytes,
sha256 `884f4e9b4a17e54ead031bca744534ca9f50e8b94d988e0ff92b83f897979c77`; installer
`private/release-110b-out/GT4Recomp-Setup-1.1.0.exe` 28,761,196 bytes, sha256
`6ad624307370998142bdfcacbd330f6cbe6a17e70e35c8ab5a2d44db8097da0d` (same game files, slice218). Launchers 1.0.0 cannot
self-update; the release notes tell those users to run the setup.

## Release 1.1.0 prepared (2026-10-21, branch `task/080-aspect-ratios`, draft release, not merged)

TASK-080 is done: the owner tested slice218 on ultrawide and approved ("funcionou perfeitamente"). Release prep on the
branch: version 1.1.0 (Cargo workspace, `tauri.conf.json`, NSIS default; release notes
[1.1.0](release-notes/1.1.0.md)); the launcher's Settings has no Display tab any more (Graphics holds the Display,
Graphics and Advanced sections; `#/settings/display` falls back to Graphics); the launcher's gt4-gs minimum is 1.1.0 and
an older install is replaced at launch (`gs_release::needs_install`); `version.json` is brought in line with the
installed versions at start. Game executable unchanged (slice218, pin `docs/inputs/slice218-pcsx2.json`). Installer
`private/release-110-out/GT4Recomp-Setup-1.1.0.exe` (sha256 `2ca0f80f8eb28023ffabe2446a30ffcdb6a139a0d96ac101fd6bc56fa7dd19de`) on a draft GitHub release v1.1.0; the coordinator
merges and publishes. Open follow-ups: P3 progressive menus (with TASK-078); split screen and photo mode in ultrawide
unverified. README: ultrawide headline, no emojis.

## TASK-080 ultrawide (2026-10-21, branch `task/080-aspect-ratios`, not merged)

Rebuilt on the 1.0.0 release recipe after merging main db99f9e: slice215 = `--mode pcsx2` on the branch (slice214 plus
native display aspect ratios: `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT`, auto by default; race camera Hor+/Vert+ hook; race view filled,
menus 16:9; protocol 1.3 for gt4-gs 1.1.0; launcher Aspect ratio row, settings schema 4 migrating the 1.0.0 file).
16:9 frames byte-identical to slice214. Owner test installer `private/release-110-test-out/GT4Recomp-Setup-ultrawide-test.exe`
(app version 1.0.0, no GitHub release). Waiting for the owner tests and approval; planned as GT4Recomp 1.1.0. Details:
[BUILD](BUILD.md) slice 215 (and 212b), decision [0071](decisions/0071-native-aspect-ratios-runtime-hooks.md).

P2 (slice217, `--mode pcsx2` on the branch): the race HUD stays the game's 16:9 layout, undistorted and centred, at any
ratio (HUD canvas hook at `RaceDisplay::render`; race font x scale and mirror divisor through the ELF patch table and the
re-translated library profile `aspect`); split screen stays 16:9. Protocol 1.3 fill carries the target aspect so a custom
ratio is letterboxed (CoreGS 1.1 already was; gt4-gs needs a release that reads it). 16:9 byte-identical (menus 42/42,
race 160/160). New owner installer and the portable folder `private/ultrawide-test-portable`. Details: [BUILD](BUILD.md)
slice 217.

Addendum (slice218, `--mode pcsx2` on the branch, owner design 2026-10-21): seamless display. No Aspect ratio and no
Internal resolution rows: the aspect is always the chosen Resolution's shape (16:9 unchanged; other ratios turn P1/P2
on), Display has Monitor and Resolution (real monitors and modes), Graphics has Render scale 50-200% with the resulting
internal resolution (k = ceil(max(W/640, H/448)), whole multipliers 1..12). Game: `GT4_OUTPUT_SIZE`, `GT4_MONITOR`,
per-monitor DPI awareness. Settings schema 5. 16:9 byte-identical (menus 42/42, race 160/160). New owner installer and
portable folder. Details: [BUILD](BUILD.md) slice 218, decision 0071 addendum.

## Current state (2026-10-21)

**TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 (2026-10-23, Claude):** owner test 6 (slice250, 4x + FXAA, 3440 x 1440) failed: every second race frame was shown from the 1x copy (GT4 reuses the buffer it is about to show as a read-only depth buffer, which dropped its scaled image; IN-377) and the ultrawide fill request never reached the in-process presenter (IN-378). Both fixed in local slice270 on top of a merge of `main` 1.2.3: display shadows with a per-pixel memory check (1x-sourced presented frames on the 480p race capture 61 -> 1 of 121 at 2x/4x/6x, memory identical to 1x), and the race fills the screen at the game's ratio like the default renderer. Owner test 7 (candidate 270) confirmed the ultrawide fill but the race still looked 1x: GT4's per-frame RGB tone curve (T8 reinterpretation, 09.4 variant A) and its full-screen copies through a 1024 x 512 REGION_CLAMP texture both went through the 1x words. Fixed in local slice271 (IN-379 tone carry of the scaled image, per-pixel checked; IN-380 textures from targets need only the sampled footprint); the presented-frame check now also flags 1x pictures with a scaled HUD (low-detail frames 121 -> 1 of 121). Owner test 8 (candidate 271, 6x + AA) passed: races at real resolution; the beta minimum (upscaling and AA) is met in races. New owner requirement: GSdx-level performance at the same scale. Local slice272: 480i menus at scale (IN-381, GPU deinterlace in native rows), the tone sequence is no longer repeated at scale (IN-382: 1.3-2 ms less GPU per race frame, same picture), clean per-category measurement (6x race 17.1 ms GPU busy, GS thread about 11 ms) and a ranked parity plan. Waiting for owner test 9 (`build\hwr-play-scale.ps1 -Scale 1|2|4|6 [-AA]`, candidate `O:\gt4recomp-scratch\coregs2-candidate-272`), see [PROGRESS](hw-renderer-spec/PROGRESS.md).

**TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 (2026-10-22, Claude):** owner test 5 on local slice247 approved (flat 60 FPS in the Nordschleife Time Trial, a night race and Opera Paris; 0 dropped frames; colours, textures and flares as GSdx at 1x). The branch now merges `main` 1.2.2 (TASK-084 VBlank journal, chain jobs, GIF fast path): the held VSYNC reaches the hw sink in stream order (fixture `hw_stream_sink_deferred_vsync`); hw memory hashes, menu dumps and race frames identical to slice247 on local slice248. The merge also fixes a donor-mode crash present in release 1.2.2 (an uninitialised `post_vsync` callback in `mtvu::Donor`: `GT4_RENDERER` unset crashed at the first VBlank; default renderer 42/42 = slice214 again). Upscaling (2x-8x, `GT4_HW_SCALE`) and FXAA (`GT4_HW_POSTFX=fxaa`) are in local slice250 (IN-371..IN-376): races render at scale through a second, presentation-only copy of every target, so memory and readbacks stay identical to 1x at every scale; menus (480i) still show at 1x. Waiting for owner test 6 (`build\hwr-play-scale.ps1 -Scale N [-AA]`), see [PROGRESS](hw-renderer-spec/PROGRESS.md).

**TASK-027 CoreGS 2.0 resumed (owner decision, 2026-10-21):** development branch `task/027-coregs2` (worktree
`C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-027-coregs2`) = `main` 1.0.0 + the paused TASK-027 work, without paraLLEl-GS. With
`GT4_HW_GS=ON`, `GT4_RENDERER=hw` sends main's GS stream hooks to the in-process HWR backend (black output; nothing
drawn yet); the default renderer stays byte-identical (check build slice216, [BUILD](BUILD.md) slice 216). The
implementation goes to an external clean-room agent (GPT 6.1 Sol); brief `AGENT-BRIEF-COREGS2.md` on that branch. The shader IN-07 AEM mismatch is now fixed: fresh slice217 build and all three GPU exactness fixtures pass. Native v2 capture replay now passes 69/69 CPU-library tests and produces 1,101/1,101 byte-identical PPMs from legacy, converted v2 and fresh donor v2 menus (slice219). Default headless output remains 42/42 identical to slice214. The CPU replay now has a calibrated direct VRAM output (local221,75/75 tests). Correct frame pairing explains the historical IN-315 offset; the A+D vertex kick gap (IN-326) was the cause of the garage frame900 defect (IN-316), fixed in local222 (76/76 tests): the same menu capture now has11/11 aligned samples inside the2D thresholds (garage0.2051%,45.992dB), while990/1,096 VRAM and995/1,101 scanout images stay unchanged outside frames811..916. The M4 GPU write-back path is now ported from `task/027-m4-gpuref`, built and wired into the backend (IN-329, local223): eleven fixtures pass, the default renderer stays 42/42 and `GT4_RENDERER=hw` runs 600 headless frames with 0 faults, but nothing is dumped yet. The M5 pixel pipeline is now wired into the same draw stage (blend unit over 81 modes, COLCLAMP, PABE, alpha test, DATE, FBA, FBMASK, dither) with five new GPU-versus-CPU fixtures at zero mismatches, and the headless HWR run stays clean at about 62 ms per frame. Actual composed scanout phase still needs M6 qualification. The M6 presentation interfaces are decided (IN-331) with the owner's variable-frame-rate requirements: a present scheduler decoupled from the VBlank (hold/re-present, newest-wins backlog, late-input hook), auxiliary frames that restore guest memory and refuse readbacks, and per-pass CPU timers. Parity is unchanged (default 42/42). HWR frame dumps now work (`GT4_HW_DUMP_DIR`, IN-332): 4,200 headless frames with 0 faults produce the same 42-dump schedule as the donor renderer. The first measurement is 42/42 frames outside the 2D gate: the boot text loses one line and the garage list keeps content from the previous screen, so some primitives never write. The new HWR replay tool (IN-333) replays the same capture through both paths: every EVEN frame is pixel-identical, every ODD frame loses content (the first boot text line, 4,394 pixels; garage 10.6%). So the defect is field-parity dependent draw loss in the GPU path, not textures or the front end. The memory-level comparison (IN-334) shows the odd-field loss is a VRAM WRITE problem: the two shadow memories differ only in the framebuffer pages that hold the boot text (6,591 bytes), while even frames match byte for byte. That loss is now fixed (IN-335, local slice228): the GPU write-back wrote stale depth words back over a frame buffer that shares pages with the unused depth buffer. The menu capture now replays with 678/1,101 frames byte-identical to the CPU reference (the rest inside the gate, IN-336), and the headless game run has 42/42 dumps inside the chapter 14.4 2D gate against the donor renderer (before: 0/42). The presentation now follows the VBlank field (13.3 offset, 13.4 deinterlace; IN-337/IN-338, local slice229): static menu screens no longer bob between VBlanks. Next: owner test 1 (windowed look at 1x), then M7.

**TASK-081 release 1.0.0 hardening (branch `task/081-release-1-0-0`, waiting for the owner's installer test):**
- Game: slice213 = the slice211 recipe with `-DGT4_RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=ON` (no build-time shader folder in the
  executable; shaders only from `<exe folder>\shaders`). slice214 = slice213 plus the Vulkan baseline path (older
  drivers: swapchain maintenance 1 only when present, `GT4_VULKAN_FORCE_BASELINE=1`). `--mode pcsx2` = slice214,
  `pcsx2-slice213` and `pcsx2-slice211` kept. String scan
  clean; headless 42/42 frames identical to slice211; CTest and Python green ([BUILD](BUILD.md) slice 213).
- Launcher: release build through `launcher/tools/build-release.ps1` (`--remap-path-prefix`; no user or build path in
  `GT4Recomp.exe`); processor (SSE4.1, owner decision) and Vulkan 1.2 checks before setup and Play; the controls crate's built-in
  keyboard keys now match the TASK-076 layout (they were the old Z/X table, which a remap would have written to
  `controls.toml`).
- Installer: WebView2 detection plus Microsoft's Evergreen bootstrapper, name `GT4Recomp-Setup-1.0.0.exe`, the
  uninstaller removes `SDL3.dll`. Built in `private/release-100-out` with `SHA256SUMS`; draft GitHub release v1.0.0
  (not published). Release notes: [1.0.0](release-notes/1.0.0.md); steps: [RELEASES](RELEASES.md).
- Saves in Documents (owner request): saves and replays live in `Documents\Gran Turismo 4` (`Saves`, `Replays`; the
  Documents known folder, data-folder fallback); everything else, including the live `runtime\card.ps2`, stays in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp`. An older AppData library is copied, checked (size, sha256) and parked as
  `library.migrated-<t>` at the first start; the guard protects the player's folder; the uninstaller never touches it.
  See [FLOW-AUDIT section 8](launcher/FLOW-AUDIT.md) and [MIGRATIONS](launcher/MIGRATIONS.md).
- Settings feedback (owner, 2026-10-21): 480p and 16:9 are fixed (the Input resolution, Widescreen 16:9 and GS
  Aspect ratio rows are gone; the launcher always sends `GT4_FORCE_480P=1` and `GT4_FORCE_WIDESCREEN=1` and writes
  `AspectRatio = 16:9`); PCSX2's own OSD rows are hidden and always written off (GS table column `forced`); Advanced
  is a section at the bottom of Graphics, not a tab. Old values are ignored by a load-time rule (settings stay
  schema 3). See [GS-SETTINGS](GS-SETTINGS.md) and [MIGRATIONS](launcher/MIGRATIONS.md).
- Next: the owner installs from the draft and tests end to end (ideally also an NVIDIA or Intel PC and a fresh Windows
  user), approves, then the merge and the publish.

## Earlier state (2026-10-17)

**TASK-044 (packaging, docs only, branch `task/044-packaging`):** release 1.0.0 ships gt4-gs 1.0.1 (`gt4gs-v1.0.1`, the
renderer already pinned for `--mode pcsx2`). The fork's release notes were edited (upstream base PCSX2 v2.8.2, commit
`fd9d310cc`; patch list; GPL-3.0 and source; SHA256SUMS). README (renderers, known issues, license and legal),
[THIRD_PARTY](../native/THIRD_PARTY.md) and [RELEASE-1.0.0-PLAN](RELEASE-1.0.0-PLAN.md) are updated. No build, no game run.
Release order: the launcher and installer (TASK-019, TASK-043), the owner's end-to-end test, then the v1.0.0 tag.

**slice206 (TASK-017 done, branch `task/017-license-crash`, main `ed123ed` merged in):** `--mode pcsx2` = slice206, the
slice203 game recipe (gt4-gs 1.0.1) plus the license demo guard v2 (capsule `private/slice206-license-guard-runtime`,
`ps2game.lib` unchanged). License demos that decrypt wrong (our FPU is not bit-exact, so 0 of 592 pass the game CRC; 52
of the 85 US demos land in the wrong phase) get record count 0xFFFFFFFF at both demo loaders (0x001100D0 and 0x00110230),
so the licenses are playable and those demos do not play, as in PCSX2 default. Memory-card loads check the CRC
themselves; replays and ghosts from a real PS2 card fail to load cleanly. Consumer map and remaining risk:
[LICENSE-DEMO-CIPHER](LICENSE-DEMO-CIPHER.md). Halt dump and FSV trace are built in, off unless GT4_HALT_DUMP /
GT4_FSV_TRACE. New `--play-card PATH` (a separate private test card, never `private/manual-play/card.ps2`). CTest
33/33 (native_memcard_store and native_license_guard now registered), Python suite with GT4_NATIVE_BUILD = slice206 all
passing. `pcsx2-slice203` and `license-guard` (slice205, guard v1) kept. Follow-up TASK-063: bit-exact div.s/mul.s.

Earlier (2026-10-16):

**slice203 (TASK-044, branch `task/044-gs-101`):** the slice202 game executable (same hash) with the stable gt4-gs 1.0.1
(tag `gt4gs-v1.0.1`, fork PR #7 merged as `d90c0f111`), which no longer writes under `Documents\PCSX2`. `--mode pcsx2` = slice203;
`pcsx2-slice202` kept. Checks: Python 472 run (18 skipped), CTest 29/30 (`python_native_contracts` uses the stale slice202 build path),
donor 42/42 = slice202, pcsx2 4200 frames 41/41 = slice202 (1x), no-JIT check of the 1.0.1 package passed, `Documents\PCSX2`
unchanged. [BUILD](BUILD.md) slice 203.

TASK-039 tooling follow-up (external contribution by Gustavo Canepa, PR #36, `fix/duplicate-gs-json-settings`): duplicate JSON setting ids now
raise the same error as duplicate CLI assignments. The 58 GS settings module tests pass, including
unchanged default INI output; no native build or gameplay validation was performed for this change.

**slice202 (main `b955235` merged into `task/060-062-osd`):** one candidate with the owner-approved TASK-058/059 (crash-safe
memory card, installed-folder paths, `--portable-check`, `make_distribution.py`) and TASK-060/061/062 (cursor, shader
notice, overlay) on the stable gt4-gs 1.0.0. CTest 30/30, Python 469 OK, donor 42/42, pcsx2 41/41 = slice201, the same
from the distribution folder, `--portable-check` ok. `--mode pcsx2` was slice202 until slice203 (gt4-gs 1.0.1). [BUILD](BUILD.md) slice202.

**slice201 (TASK-060/061/062, branch `task/060-062-osd`, fork `gt4gs/osd`, `gt4gs-v1.0.0` stable):** the mouse cursor
hides over the picture after 3 s without movement in fullscreen and windowed mode (game window and gt4-gs child agree
through protocol 1.2 CONTROL cursor; `GT4_CURSOR_AUTOHIDE=0` keeps it); gt4-gs shows "Compiling shaders…" bottom-left
while it really compiles (pipeline cache hits excluded); an optional top-right performance overlay (FPS, frame time,
CPU and GPU usage of the game and gt4-gs, resolutions, EE/VU1/GS write/readback/GS thread ms and the headroom) fed by
protocol 1.2 OSD_STATS (+0.35 us/frame on the EE thread, +0.02 ms/frame GS thread). Internal resolution presets 480p to
8K (default 1080p); gt4-gs 1.0.0 ignores INI keys outside the allow-list with a warning and is the **first stable
gt4-gs release** (zip sha256 `2e878019...`). CTest 30/30, Python 455 OK, donor 42/42, pcsx2 1x 41/41 = slice199,
no-JIT check passes. `--mode pcsx2` = slice201, `--mode pcsx2-slice199` kept. Owner windowed test pending.
[GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md) section 11.
**slice200 (TASK-058 crash-safe memory card, TASK-059 installed folder; branch `task/058-059-release-hardening` from main `3b5334d`):** `--mode pcsx2` = slice200 (`docs/inputs/slice200-pcsx2.json`, game build `private/slice200-build`, 95,680,000 bytes). The runtime writes the card atomically through the TASK-025 writer (memcard capsule, dirty retry, flush on exit and after the GS-loss grace VSYNCs). The executable finds `shaders\` and `gs\gt4-gs.exe` next to itself, has `--portable-check`, and `scripts/make_distribution.py` assembles the folder (`private/slice200-dist`, 16 files, no GS package, no game data; `docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`). Checks: CTest 29/29; Python kill test, portable-check and distribution tests; donor 42/42 identical to slice157; pcsx2 41/41 identical to slice199, both run from the distribution folder. The headless schedule never saves, so the card check is the fixture and kill test; the in-game save is the owner's test. `--mode main` is not rebuilt. No PR opened.

**slice199 (TASK-041 on the JIT-free gt4-gs 0.4.0, branch `task/041-gs-perf`, fork `gt4gs/nojit`, `gt4gs-v0.4.0`):** the slice198 game build (same file and hash) with the JIT-free gt4-gs 0.4.0 package of slice197. `--mode pcsx2` = slice199; `--mode pcsx2-slice198` and `--mode pcsx2-slice197` stay for A/B. Owner test of slice198 (gt4-gs 0.3.2) on 2026-10-16, night race with 5 AI: 59.97 FPS, 53 late frames (69 before), EE waits for the VU1 worker 2.99 ms (3.48 before), readback 0.69 ms, EE critical path 11.81 of 16.68 ms (71%), headroom 4.87 ms, no frametime spikes once the shader cache was warm. CTest 29/29, Python 438 OK, 20 skipped; donor 42/42 identical to slice157; pcsx2 1x 41/41 identical to slice198; no-JIT static check passes on the package. [GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md) sections 9 and 10. Owner night-race check on 0.4.0 pending.

**slice198 (TASK-041, branch `task/041-gs-perf`, fork unchanged, `gt4gs-v0.3.2`):** performance of the PCSX2 GS path.
A headless race schedule (El Capitan, 5 AI) reproduces the night-race privileged-write pattern: the 3.48 ms/frame
`gs_privileged` wait is the EE waiting for the frame's VU1 work at the CSR write right before the flare readback.
`GT4_MTVU_PRIV_ASYNC=1` (default) queues privileged writes in the MTVU journal: byte-identical stream and frames, the
gs_privileged wait is 0 but moves to the readback's download sync (no net gain expected in the night race). Long
readbacks are pipeline compiles (cold cache max 58 ms, warm 2.7 ms; TASK-046). Wake batching (`GT4_GS_WAKE_BYTES`)
cuts GS wake-ups from 322 to about 12 per frame and `gs_ipc_write` by about 30% per MB. F8 `[gs-ipc]` gains
per-register lines and an EE critical path summary. CTest 29/29, Python 416 OK, donor 42/42, pcsx2 41/41.
Owner test 2026-10-16 (see slice199 above). `--mode pcsx2` was slice198 until slice199. [GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md) section 9.

**slice197 (TASK-042, branch `task/042-gs-nojit`, fork `gt4gs/nojit`, `gt4gs-v0.4.0`):** JIT-free `gt4-gs.exe`. Build
option `GT4GS_ONLY`: no EE/IOP/VU/VIF recompilers, no x86 emitter, no GS software JIT (C rasterizer), no executable
memory; Windows Arbitrary Code Guard on at start (works with the AMD Vulkan driver). Static check passes (0.3.2: 22
markers); replayed menu frames byte-identical to 0.3.2 at 1x and 3x; GS thread time unchanged within noise. CTest
29/29, Python 414 OK, donor 42/42, live pcsx2 41/41 = slice196. `--mode pcsx2` was slice197 until slice199 (same game runtime). Owner
windowed check pending. [GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md) section 10.


**slice196 (TASK-047, branch `task/047-gs-deinterlace`, fork `gt4gs/deinterlace`, `gt4gs-v0.3.2`):** 480i menus in the
PCSX2 GS mode. Cause: the stream had no SYNCV (PCSX2 never deinterlaced; fields line-doubled and bouncing) and,
once SYNCV is sent, gt4-gs 0.3.1 used the previous VSYNC's field (wrong order, combing). Fix: SetGsCrt posts SYNCV;
protocol 1.1 VSYNC field = display field; gt4-gs 0.3.2 uses it. Garage menu: comb 0.50 -> 0.57 with flicker 3.23 ->
0; progressive unchanged. CTest 29/29, Python 410 OK, donor 42/42. `--mode pcsx2` = slice196. Owner menu check
pending. [GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md) section 8.

**slice195 (TASK-038 click fix):** owner night race with slice194: accurate 59.97 FPS, 69 late frames (was 213),
unsynchronized 60.00 FPS but headlight flares missing; accurate stays the default. A click on the picture deactivated
the game window; gt4-gs 0.3.1 gives the foreground back (visible click fixture passes). `--mode pcsx2` = slice195.

**TASK-037/038 (slice194, branch `task/037-038-gs-window`, fork `gt4gs/window`, tag `gt4gs-v0.3.0`):** night-race late
frames explained (one readback per frame removes the GS buffering, so shader/pipeline compiles and GS-thread spikes
land in the game frame; the shader cache was in `Documents\PCSX2`, not in our folder). Readback modes
`--gs-readback accurate|unsynchronized`, F8 readback histograms, our own cache/data folders, deferred swap chain
acquire, window hardening (detached input queues, minimize, close while the GS window hangs) and crash handling
(card flush grace, restart offer). CTest 29/29, Python 350 OK, donor 42/42, pcsx2 41/41. Owner windowed test pending.
[GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md) section 6.

**TASK-036 (slice193, branch `task/036-gs-live`, fork `gt4gs/live`, 2026-10-16):** the live PCSX2 GS process
`gt4-gs.exe` runs the game's GS stream (`--mode pcsx2`, `--gs-scale N`). Headless: CTest 29/29, Python 335 OK,
donor frames 42/42, live frames 41/41 identical to the offline `--replay-gscap` frames and frames 300/700 identical
to the TASK-034 PoC; a killed GS process halts the game cleanly. Owner windowed test at 1x and 3x pending.
[GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md).

## Earlier state (2026-10-15)

**Current renderer plan (2026-10-15, [decision 0070](decisions/0070-pcsx2-gs-separate-process.md)):** TASK-032 (decision docs) is done in its PR; TASK-034 (PCSX2 GS proof of concept) is in progress, with an owner go/no-go gate before TASK-035/036. paraLLEl-GS (TASK-012) is dropped; CoreGS 1.1 stays the built-in fallback. Plan: [GSDX-PLAN](GSDX-PLAN.md).

**TASK-035 (slice191, branch `task/035-gs-stream`, 2026-10-15):** the MIT GS stream protocol ([spec](GS-STREAM-PROTOCOL.md)), shared-memory transport and the `GT4_RENDERER=pcsx2` seam are built and checked headless (CTest 29/29, Python 321 OK; donor frames 42/42 identical; the stream is byte-identical in donor mode, pcsx2 mode and in the recorder process; the converted stream equals the TASK-034 PoC dump and replays to identical GSRunner frames). The consumer is a test recorder, so `--mode pcsx2-stream` shows no image until TASK-036. Owner review pending.

**Latest (merged to main):** TASK-008 slice 157 (all 2,048 VU1 entries, owner: night
58.9, rally 59.9, showroom 60.0 VBlanks/s, 0 interpreted VU1 calls), TASK-010 build
pipeline (slice 159) and TASK-009 slice 164 `--mode quickfix3 --force-480p` (title,
16:9, fullscreen, races held at 480p; owner approved). In flight: TASK-012 paraLLEl-GS
(step 5 headless, textures missing), TASK-013 VU0 AOT (owner test), TASK-014 stage A.
TASK-011 MTVU (branch `task/011-mtvu`, release 1.0.0 W1): slice 178 `--mode main` runs the VU1 worker
(slice 172 runtime, `GT4_MTVU` default on, `GT4_MTVU=0` is the A/B switch) and holds 480p by default.
Headless 42/42 identical with MTVU on (three runs), off (one run) and default. PR ready for review; owner A/B and approval pending.

**Earlier:** slice 154 `--mode vu1-flags` (executable `800da980`) adds VU1 flag
elision: showroom 59.14 VBlanks/s (was 44.79), 5-AI race 60.00 at 480p. Next:
full static VU1 entry coverage: slice 155 `--mode vu1-full` (426 entries) is
built and checked headless, waiting for the owner test.

2026-10-15 — Slice 154, O1 follow-up (candidate, not owner-measured): `--mode vu1-flags` = slice 153 pacing with a VU1 table that computes MAC and clip only where a reader or the exit observes them (exit state exact); VU1 status is not kept, since the image never reads it and the EE cannot read VU1 flags. Local evidence: corpus differential 0 failures over 100 programs, fixture differential 0 failures, 42 identical headless frames versus slice 153, verify smoke with 0 mismatches. Read [journal 2026-10-15](journal/2026-10-15.md) and [BUILD](BUILD.md).

Integration branch `main`. Machine: Ryzen 7
5700X, RX 9060 XT. Plan: [OPTIMIZATION-PLAN](OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md). Journal:
[2026-10-15](journal/2026-10-15.md).

**Playable candidate:** slice 153 `--mode pacing` (executable `c8d31fdf`):
VU1 AOT (102 entries) + asynchronous GS submission + single-clock pacing with
rate-controlled audio. A/B switches: `GT4_PACING=audio`, `GT4_GS_SYNC=1`,
`--vu1-interpret-only`, `--vu1-verify N`, `GT4_PRESENT_MODE`.

**Confirmed (owner measurements):**

| Scene | VBlanks/s | Speed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time Trial, Nordschleife, Supra, 480p | 60.00 | 100% | median 16.665 ms, 99.6% of intervals 16-17 ms |
| Arcade race, Nordschleife, 5 AI | 57.98 | 96.6% | VU1 8.4 ms |
| Replay | 59.10 | 98.5% | |
| Night race | 46.15 | 76.9% | uncompiled VU1 entries (3.7 ms interpreted) + 4.1 ms GS wait (readback suspected) |
| Rally, Grand Canyon | 53.85 | 89.8% | uncompiled VU1 entries, VU1 11.3 ms |
| Car showroom | 44.79 | 74.6% | VU1 16.2 ms, 46k primitives/frame |

Starting point the same day was about 30 FPS and 51% speed (VU1 interpreted
17 ms, synchronous GS wait 10.8 ms). VU1 AOT verified on real game state
(140,034 in-game comparisons, 0 mismatches). RTSS overlay works on AMD since the
swapchain requests color-attachment usage.

**Known issues:** license tests crash in every configuration (pre-existing;
traced to `RaceSolitaire::loadDemoInputs` → `AutomobileControlRecord::Manager::load`
reading a bad record count); night/rally VU1 entry coverage; showroom VU1 load;
night GS readback wait; counters `late_frames`/`audio_underruns` look
session-cumulative.

**In progress / next:** VU1 per-program flag elimination (slice 154, subagent);
then full static VU1 entry coverage, MTVU (VU1 thread, default on), window title
"GT4Recomp" and fixed 16:9 (remove F6/4:3), license-crash instrumentation, LDL/LDR
semantics check, GS readback counting/staging, Vulkan (GS) internal scale 2-3x
experiment, then O3 (VU0 AOT, EE entry coverage, IOP review, build tuning).

## History (newest first)

2026-10-15 — Slice 178, release 1.0.0 W1 (candidate, not owner-measured): `--mode main` is the build of main with the
MTVU worker runtime (slice 172 capsule, byte-identical; `GT4_MTVU` default 1, 0 is the single-thread path) and holds the race
display at 480p by default (hidden opt-out `GT4_FORCE_480P=0`). Build `private/slice178-main-build` (pin `docs/inputs/slice178-main.json`),
CTest 27/27, Python 281 OK (12 skipped), headless 4,200 frames 42/42 identical to slice157 in four runs (on x3, off x1) plus one
default-environment run. `--mode mtvu` keeps slice 172. Details: BUILD.md "Slice178", MTVU-PLAN section 12.

2026-10-15 — Slice 153, O4 frame pacing (candidate, not owner-measured): `--mode pacing` (VU1 AOT plus asynchronous GS, as slice 152) with one 60 Hz wall-clock guest VBlank grid, non-blocking audio (16 x 256-frame buffers, 60 ms target, +-0.5 % resample control), and `GT4_PACING=audio` for the old blocking clock. FIFO stays default; `GT4_PRESENT_MODE` for experiments. Local checks: pacing and paced-device fixtures, CTest 18/18, Python 217 OK, 42 identical headless frames versus slice 152. Owner measurement pending. Read [journal 2026-10-15](journal/2026-10-15.md) and [BUILD](BUILD.md).

2026-10-14 — Slice 152, O2 asynchronous GS submission (candidate, not owner-measured):
`--mode gs-async` = VU1 AOT plus a three-slot submission ring on one timeline semaphore,
presentation merged into the slot submission, at most two presents in flight, cache
eviction guarded by completion, and `GT4_GS_SYNC=1` for synchronous A/B. Confirmed headless:
4200-frame dumps identical sync vs async; stress VRAM byte-identical; CTest 17/17; Python 203
OK. Synchronization validation is clean with overlay layers disabled; with the installed
overlay layers it reports present-after-write (pre-existing class). Step 0: swapchain now
requests COLOR_ATTACHMENT (overlay layers previously hit render-pass VUIDs). Owner gameplay,
overlay check and frame timing pending. Read [GS async design](GS-ASYNC-DESIGN.md#implementation-status-slice-152).

2026-10-14 — Slice 151, owner replanning: [Optimization Plan](OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md)
and [decision 0065](decisions/0065-aot-all-guest-code-no-jit.md) set the order of work:
VU1 AOT first (donor recording + `vurecomp` flow never activated for GT4; all VU1
calls hit the interpreter), then asynchronous GS submission, then VU0-micro/IOP AOT
and EE build tuning. Read-only source review; no build, run or code change.
Branch `codex/optimization-plan-151` from slice 150.

2026-10-14 — Slice 150, owner split report identifies VU1 interpreted wall cost.
Playable base remains slice114; slice143 includes slice136's keyboard correction.
Active track: `codex/hybrid-no-jit-port-plan-141`; slice143 based on5c7ab92.
`main` retains slice140/native-scene work; this candidate stays on the hybrid track.
Slice 118 candidates remain separate and owner gameplay qualification is pending.

## Active priority on this branch

**Confirmed (slice143):** portable timing core is connected to a separately pinned
production-EE player. Measures exclusive/inclusive wall categories and owner-thread
CPU time, clips active scopes and guest counters at VBlank boundaries, preserves
keyboard correction, excludes shape capture and inherited guest tuning settings.
F7 starts a continuous manual interval, F8 reports, F9 pauses/resumes diagnostics.
Candidate native CTest7/7; separate macro-off observation controls9/9,
Python171/171 zero skips, warning-free builds. Launcher retains card/backup/lock flow.
**Confirmed (slice144):** owner F8 report saved completely:970/970 samples across
40.323s,24.06 VBlanks/s; no invalid/reset marker. Exclusive wall sum reconciles
within printed rounding. VU interpretation25.646ms/sample is61.69% of the interval;
GS fence wait9.392ms/sample is completion latency, not GPU execution time.
Owner identifies that interval as Toyota Prius, external camera, Nordschleife;
year/trim, exact position and GT4 video setting are not supplied.
**Unknown:** diagnostic overhead and exact interval scene composition,
distinct scene frame rate and GPU timestamp time. No performance improvement
claim. VU is the leading observed wall category; qualify overhead and the matching
scene before choosing an optimization. No runtime changes in this verification.
**Confirmed (slice145):** fresh detailed and frame-only profiles share production
EE/runtime/port/shaders and all guest settings. Frame-only compiles subsystem
scopes and host operation counter hooks out; common boundary CPU/wall clocks and
guest progress counters remain. Native CTest7/7 each, separate full9/9 with
Python173/173 zero skips. Object-symbol controls confirm no Probe references in
five frame-only hot-path objects. Owner closed143 normally and completed the145
detailed trial recorded below. Matched control intervals remain pending.
Next: owner matched detailed/control/detailed intervals, then VU0-micro/VU1 timing
separation and one content-identified offline AOT experiment. No speedup claim.
**Confirmed (slice146):**145 detailed manual interval covers962 samples/40.732s,
23.62 VBlanks/s, median42.065ms; VU26.246ms (61.99%), GS fence9.392ms,
owner-thread CPU32.533ms/76.8%. SecondF8 covers only2.704s, recorded separately.
Independent review and arithmetic controls pass; detailed session closed normally,
card hashes unchanged. Owner confirmed closure;145 frame-only now open through
protected launcher. Its manual interval/overhead result remain pending.
Owner screenshot is a single logical-CPU/overlay snapshot: no fixed CPU at100%
does not rule out serial work with waits/migration; neither migration nor thermal
limiting is measured. See [detailed evidence](inputs/slice146-owner-detailed-results.json).
**Confirmed (slice147):**145 frame-only report covers1175 samples/56.199s,
20.91VBlanks/s, median46.311ms,p9983.614ms, threadCPU37.274ms/77.9%.
Complete five-line report, normal closure, unchanged card and independent review
pass. It is slower than detailed in this one sample; different durations/scenes/
machine state prevent causal overhead attribution. Protected145 detailed repeat
now open, owner controls F7/F8. No optimization or thermal-cause conclusion.
See [control evidence](inputs/slice147-owner-control-results.json).
**Confirmed (slice148):** detailed repeat1191 samples/53.161s, median43.779ms,
p9956.683ms, threadCPU35.094ms/78.6%, VU28.155ms. Normal close/card unchanged;
exclusive partition and independent log checks pass. Initial sequence medians
42.065/46.311/43.779ms: control slower than both detailed runs. Causal overhead
remains Unknown under varying scenes/durations/machine state; no more repeats of
this initial sequence requested now. Next is a fresh VU0-micro/VU1-interpreter
scope split, keeping149+ candidate separate from frozen143/145. No optimization.
See [sequence evidence](inputs/slice148-owner-aba-results.json).
**Confirmed (slice149):** fresh pinned source capsule replaces aggregate run_fast
timing with disjoint VU0-micro/VU1-interpreter categories. Old aggregate stays zero;
derived rollup is separate from the16-category partition. Core controls prove70us
aggregate equals20+50us split after active cut/nested waits. Native7/7, separate
full9/9 with Python175 zero skips. Initial category rejection was caught/corrected
by fixtures/review. Frozen143/145 unchanged; no algorithm/clock optimization.
Next owner F7/F8 interval identifies the slower interpreter unit. VU0 macro in EE
and generated VU1 AOT are outside this scope. [Candidate](inputs/slice149-vu-unit-attribution.json).
Independent final artifact gate passed; protected149 player initialized native
Vulkan/audio with verified backup, then owner completed and closed the150 session.
**Confirmed (slice150):** completed149 interval1139 samples/49.161s,
median42.711ms. VU1 interpreted26.987ms is62.53% of interval wall; VU0 micro
prints0.000ms (rounded, not proof of no calls). VU0 macro remains in EE; generated
VU1 AOT excluded. GS completion wait9.367ms is next largest category. All16 terms
sum within rounding; normal close/card unchanged. [Evidence](inputs/slice150-owner-vu-split-results.json).
Owner additionally reports menu pacing sometimes43FPS then60FPS in the same
opening. Screenshot/description recorded only; cause and transition timing Unknown.
Next: bounded VU1 content-key/call inventory before selecting one offline-AOT
program. No menu audit/fix or runtime optimization in150; no new game launch.

See [attribution](PERFORMANCE-ATTRIBUTION.md#playable-diagnostic-candidate-slice143)
and [candidate pins](inputs/slice143-performance-candidate.json).
Protected candidate launch confirmed native Vulkan/16:9/48kHz initialization and
per-session card backup; owner controls the open game. Manual report and immutable
observed prefix preserved privately; see [report evidence](inputs/slice144-owner-performance-report.json).
Slice142 reconciled OpenCode's old executable/receipts and reproduced accounting
defects; its reported494-interval selection remains unreproduced.

Owner changed direction: optimize the hybrid base for correct game speed and
stable60FPS on Windows, then add GS internal scaling/dithering and portability.
Mobile targets: S23 Ultra/Snapdragon8 Gen2 and iPhone15 Pro Max; Windows first.
Guest JIT is excluded. AOT EE and selectively compiled VU may coexist with
qualified instruction interpreters/device models. No zero-emulation claim.
Selective PCSX2 GS implementation reuse is authorized; GPL-compatible derivative
planning and attribution are required before imports. No code/license change yet.

Independent Luna source review confirms Windows host/COFF pins, Win32 WSI and
mandatory presentation-extension dependencies. Donor has offline VU compilation
and scale-aware1..3 GS code, not qualified in our current1x adapter. Costs and
ARM64/mobile60FPS remain Unknown. No profiling/build/game action in this slice.

[slice141 evidence](inputs/slice141-hybrid-port-plan.json).

The game-scene replacement research below is preserved and deferred on this
track. Its next richer shape capture is not the default next task here. Existing
OpenCode experiments stay separate; review their measured evidence before reuse.

## Authorized P0/P1 Progress

- **Confirmed (slice 140):** exact pinned offline/capture comparison and independent
  Luna parsing align18 of22 menu Ford Ka shapes at candidate MDLS base0x01748740,
  accounting for97 calls. Other53 menu and all60 race-LOD candidate bases match
  one distinct address each. Four menu shapes are unobserved;12 other live addresses
  are outside the candidate menu extent. Ten authored matching controls pass.
- **High confidence:** partial loaded menu-asset layout correspondence.
  **Unknown:** resource identity/lifetime, descriptor relocation/payloads, car-part
  roles, camera/transforms and geometry. No runtime/build/session/performance change.
  Next: bounded prefix/descriptor observation; see [crosswalk](LIVE-SHAPE-CROSSWALK.md)
  and [evidence](inputs/slice140-shape-crosswalk.json).

- **Confirmed (slice 139):** owner capture exports valid schema1,180767 bytes,
  256 completed records, all before/after validity masks0x3f. Started/completed257,
  dropped1 reconcile with automatic record-cap stop; no orphan/abort/rejected/
  ambiguous/incomplete sample counters. Independent bounded JSON review matches.
- **Owner context:** screenshot shows Ford Ka '01 in Arcade selection and
  `capture saved`. **Unknown:** which of30 distinct raw shape arguments belong
  to that car, geometry and submission ownership. No timestamps/frame IDs exist;
  capture speed/duration is not measured. Original preserved and frozen private
  copy hash-matched. Game remains owner-controlled. See
  [capture verification](inputs/slice139-live-capture.json).

- **Confirmed (slice 138):** owner reported capture began before the car appeared
  and explicitly requested close/reopen. Delivered normal close; exit0/session
  completion confirmed, previous capture preserved. Qualified136 reopened with
  the same save, fresh backup/session and capture off. This authorization covers
  this restart only; owner still controls scene navigation and F8. Target scene
  remains unqualified. See [retry evidence](inputs/slice138-owner-capture-retry.json).

- **Confirmed (slice 137):** owner requested opening the corrected build. Old134
  session closed normally with exit0; qualified136 runtime launched with existing
  save and a fresh8650752-byte backup. Native window/audio initialization logged.
  Owner controls keyboard and F8; no agent scene navigation or performance probe.
  Menu/steering/capture identity confirmation remains pending. See
  [corrected launch evidence](inputs/slice137-corrected-owner-launch.json).

- **Confirmed (slice 136):** owner separately authorized the input fix blocking
  car selection. Arrows previously emitted both a digital D-pad bit and a full
  left-stick axis; keyboard merge now emits only buttons/pressures. XInput axes,
  rumble and all other button mappings remain unchanged. No arbitrary debounce.
- **Confirmed (slice 136):** fresh CTest7/7 in13.03s and Python164/164, zero skips.
  Native controls cover all16 keyboard bits, four directions, hold/release/chord
  and preservation of non-neutral XInput axes. The same new fixture rejects the
  old implementation specifically for non-neutral keyboard-derived axes.
- **High confidence:** duplicate digital/analog channels explain the reported
  menu double movement. **Unknown:** owner keyboard/menu confirmation and digital
  D-pad steering in races. The strict capture launcher now selects the frozen136
  candidate; physical input/game navigation remains owner-controlled.
  See [keyboard evidence](inputs/slice136-keyboard-input.json).

The owner authorized P0/P1 while OpenCode continues its separate performance
branch. Work uses an isolated checkout; no OpenCode edits, session or saves changed.

- **Confirmed (slice 131):** all 328 reviewed two-probe sources copied into a
  fresh producer and all 327 AMD64 objects rebuilt. Exactly 326 normalized object
  payloads match baseline; only D5 changes and matches its independent slice 129
  unit compilation. Compiler recipe differs only in generated-source directory.
- **Confirmed (slice 131):** producer CTest 1/1, Python 155/155 with zero skips,
  using frozen slice 130 native fixtures. This does not repeat their native build.
- **Unknown:** retail runtime linkage, live shape identity/reachability and capture
  overhead. The ordinary playable target and launcher remain unchanged.
  See [full library evidence](inputs/slice131-observation-library.json).
- **Confirmed (slice 132):** fresh `observation` native profile links the pinned
  full probe library and reviewed runtime overlays directly into its game target.
  Ordinary production selection is unchanged; the runtime archive stays original.
  Capture starts disabled and empty; activation/export remain unimplemented.
- **Confirmed (slice 132):** CTest 5/5 and Python 155/155, zero skips. Actual game
  map/graph checks cover retained EE hooks, boot, adapter and D5. Synthetic guest
  outputs still match their unoverlaid control. Invalid profile/missing overlay,
  extra header and post-configure source edit are rejected before compilation.
- **Unknown:** this candidate's boot/gameplay, live shape association and overhead.
  No game session launched. See [runtime evidence](inputs/slice132-observation-runtime.json).
- **Confirmed (slice 133):** fixed metadata-only JSON preserves every raw argument
  lane, FPR/SP bits, original owner identities, counters and before/after validity.
  It requires a stopped observer and exclusively creates a new file. Actual native
  controls cover 0/1/256 records, no overwrite, invalid reason and missing parent.
- **Confirmed (slice 133):** fresh CTest 6/6, Python 156/156, zero skips. Exporter
  remains fixture-only; no window hook, game activation or owner capture added.
- **Unknown:** injected write/flush/cleanup/close failures and crash atomicity;
  partial cleanup may fail. The host path is caller-trusted; no public path UI.
  Next: owner capture latch at the EE vblank boundary and fresh private launcher
  output, then owner-led scene evidence. See [export evidence](inputs/slice133-capture-export.json).
- **Confirmed (slice 134):** observation-only F8 latches a start/stop request;
  the EE-owned vblank host boundary services it. One capture per launch, default
  off; manual, capacity/ambiguity stop and shutdown preserve/export fixed records.
  Failed export retains records for F8 retry or one best-effort shutdown attempt.
- **Confirmed (slice 134):** launcher pins the exact manual manifest/runtime,
  clears inherited capture output, uses a new private session path and preserves
  the existing card/backup/locks. CTest 7/7 in11.72s, Python164/164, zero skips.
  Link evidence retains the control/export code; baseline graph excludes it.
- **Unknown:** physical F8, actual scene reachability/identity and runtime cost.
  Synchronous bounded export may pause a frame; no gameplay/performance probe was
  used for build qualification. Owner-led capture is next. See
  [manual capture evidence](inputs/slice134-manual-capture.json).
- **Confirmed (slice 135):** qualified134 candidate launched after checking no
  existing game process. Native window/Vulkan, Windows audio and guest IOP boot
  services are present in the startup log. Existing owner save selected; session
  backup8650752 bytes created. Capture starts off; no capture file at snapshot.
- **Unknown:** menu/race scene, physical F8 and real shape identity. No agent GUI
  navigation/input or performance measurement. The owner controls the open game.
  Startup proof is frozen separately from changing live session logs:
  [launch evidence](inputs/slice135-owner-capture-launch.json).

- **Confirmed:** fresh CORE-to-ELF reconstruction matches the pinned native ELF;
  independent verified ISO extraction produces the same CORE/ELF.
- **Confirmed:** the donor translator rebuilt with Clang 23.1.2 generates all
  328 source files identically to the frozen producer. No old CMake cache is used.
- **Confirmed:** the fresh library's 327 AMD64 object payloads match the baseline
  after normalizing only their COFF timestamps; archive paths explain the size delta.
- **Confirmed (slice 117):** producer CTest 2/2 passes; Python discovery 55 tests,
  52 passing and 3 native integration skips in the isolated checkout. These are
  not candidate runtime or gameplay qualification.
- **Confirmed:** seven model/camera candidates map to real generated registry
  entries and prefix hashes; camera helpers and model VM/callbacks have state effects.
- **Confirmed:** baseline callback starts `0x0044EA58`/`0x0044EAC8` lack generated
  bodies/entries. An offline supplier-only seed recovers both, adding 45 instructions
  and nine entries. Supplier-only/both source matches; all 18 changed units compile.
  Existing bodies/callers match under independently reviewed dispatch-ID normalization.
  Production seeds/library are unchanged. The donor EE dispatcher halts on missing code without a module
  replacement; it has no EE interpreter fallback.
- **Unknown:** live reachability of these omissions and any performance relationship.
  Generation equality is not complete-code coverage or PS2 fidelity proof.
- **Confirmed (slice 118):** complete recovered library compiled in a fresh cache;
  all 327 normalized AMD64 object members checked: exactly 18 reviewed differences,
  309 unchanged. Baseline remains the qualified rebuilt slice 116 library.
- **Confirmed (slice 118):** both isolated native runtime profiles link and pass
  CTest 3/3 and Python 59/59 with zero skips and zero observed compile warnings.
  All nine shaders match production. The actual candidate executables are used
  by native integration fixtures; no manual game session was launched during build qualification.
- **Confirmed (slice 118):** bounded research located the actual GT4.VOL header/
  offset table; parent independently verified its metadata. Page decoding, named
  car/asset/live-instance identification were Unknown at that checkpoint. No car payload was extracted.
- **Confirmed (slice 119):** six pinned research repositories cloned; Luna decoded
  all 407 ToC pages with bounded raw-DEFLATE-before-XOR processing. Parent replay
  independently matches decoded hash, 18,562 records, 210 directories, directory
  reachability and 18,352 file extent bounds. Car/SpecDB paths are now observed.
  Packed version matches GT4FS's 0x00030001 constant.
- **Unknown:** production reader/lookup qualification, named-car crosswalk,
  model/texture payloads and live instance/camera effects. No asset payload was
  read and no renderer or performance change was made in slice 119.
- **Confirmed (slice 120):** public bounded volume reader reproduces slice 119
  catalogue hashes/counts. Five selected SpecDB files extracted after whole-ISO
  verification on the same handle; strict PS2ZIP framing, sizes and hashes pass.
- **Confirmed (slice 120):** offline `ka_01` / car code 59 resolves to Ford Ka '01
  in USA GT4_US2560. Name/Grade/ShortName use localized string 84; NarrationID
  is raw integer 435. Worker and independent parent code-list Huffman replay
  match both selected rows. SpecDB decoding remains a private research probe.
- **Confirmed (slice 120):** 22 new public controls pass; existing baseline
  candidate CTest 3/3 and Python 81/81, zero skips. No native code/build change.
- **Unknown:** which menu/LOD file corresponds to this car; exact `ka_01`
  basenames and MODEL_INFO pair are absent. Eleven Ford-prefixed leaves remain
  candidates, not identified assets. No model/texture payload read or live hook added.
  B-tree key routing and comprehensive format/fidelity qualification remain open.
- **Confirmed (slice 121):** CAR_VARIATION row 59 selects VARIATION row 444/table
  42; all 11 physical variations use SDB model index 1598, `fdeu0006`. Independent
  Huffman replay matches all 12 selected row hashes. Exact garage/LOD leaves,
  not guessed Ford prefixes, are identified and extracted with verified pins.
- **Confirmed (slice 121):** both CAR4 main MDLS bases are 0xC00; garage/race
  have 4 models each and 22/113 shapes. Independent header checks match. Signed
  -1 VM words are opaque; five zero-size Tex1 slots are reported header-only.
  Geometry, texture records/pixels, relocation and live argument chain remain Unknown.
- **Confirmed (slice 121):** 17 public header controls; CTest 3/3, Python 98/98
  with zero skips. No native rebuild, live hook or runtime behavior change.
- **Confirmed (slice 122):** selected garage/racing main models contain 154/312
  bounded shape descriptors, 14/18 material records and 49/123 PGLU texture
  records plus 5/15 transfer records. Packet spans and fixed arrays are bounded;
  shape +4 is opaque, transfer storage extent and material semantics Unknown.
- **Confirmed (slice 122):** 11 new public controls; CTest 3/3, Python 109/109,
  zero skips. No VIF/vertex/pixel decoding or runtime change. Independent record
  review is recorded in [Model Records](MODEL-RECORDS.md).
- **Confirmed, conditional (slice 123):** under explicit initial CL/WL=(1,1),
  all 466 selected packet spans frame to their exact QWC end. No STCYCL appears,
  so live incoming cycle remains Unknown. No VIF/VU execution, GIF meaning,
  channels, topology, vertices or renderer substitution is qualified.
- **Confirmed (slice 123):** 11 public framing controls, CTest 3/3, Python
  120/120, zero skips. Fill cycles reduce source consumption; NUM0 expansion
  is explicit. Packed/reserved UNPACK and zero-cycle fields reject as unqualified.
- **Confirmed (slice 124, static only):** pinned ELF corroborates shape argument+4
  loaded to F12 and helper `0x0049E548`'s conditional matrix/VU and 144-byte buffer
  effects. Submission reads descriptor addresses directly; serialized relocation
  and selected live object identity remain unqualified.
- **Confirmed (slice 124, static only):** three local packet builders emit (0,4)
  then (4,4) cycle words. Channel submission, previous/live cycle and selected
  Ford Ka relation remain Unknown. Channel-role formulas remain reference leads.
- **Confirmed:** documentation-only slice, source/ELF pins and bounded independent
  review pass. Existing CTest 3/3 and Python 120/120 are inherited from slice 123;
  no new build/test or runtime change claimed.
- **Confirmed, conditional (slice 125):** 2,320 ordinary UNPACK commands supply
  157,441 raw scalar lanes under explicit cycle/signedness assumptions. Integer
  decoding preserves 32-bit patterns and opaque alignment; no channels, floats,
  geometry, VU results or live behavior inferred.
- **Confirmed (slice 125):** 11 new literal controls; CTest 3/3, Python 131/131,
  zero skips. Exact selected pins and frozen framing reproduced; no native rebuild.
- **Confirmed, conditional (slice 126):** source predicates match a position
  candidate in 466/466 packets but float-normal candidates in only 6/312 racing
  packets; 23 garage UV candidates have three components and would be skipped.
  Independent derived-data audits and complete qualified-header check agree.
- **Unknown:** actual channel/normal/UV/topology semantics. No converter adopted;
  predicate coverage is not game geometry proof. Research-only slice inherits
  CTest 3/3 and Python 131/131 from125; no new runtime/build/test claim.

- **Confirmed (slice 127, source only):** existing donor probes can observe pre-call
  0x00455A5C and registered continuation 0x00455A64 without translator changes.
  Direct dispatch bypass, depth spill/resume, stale pre-PC and reused thread IDs
  require original-input tokens and lifecycle invalidation, not a post-only hook.
- **High confidence proposal:** default-off fixed metadata observer, bounded RAM
  reads and no duplicate game evaluation. New generation/profile and lifecycle
  adapter still required. No live hook, build or gameplay qualification this slice;
  CTest 3/3/Python 131/131 inherited from125. See [Observation](SCENE-OBSERVATION.md).

- **Confirmed (slice128):** default-off fixed observation core and safe direct
  RAM/scratchpad sampler pass actual native synthetic controls. Persistent
  original inputs, exact continuation/SP, owner isolation, incarnation/epoch,
  handler skips and deterministic storage/ambiguity failure are exercised.
- **Confirmed:** fresh baseline-profile Windows/Clang build, CTest4/4 and
  Python132/132 with zero skips. Core is fixture-only, not linked into playable
  runtime. Generated probes, lifecycle adapter and live evidence remain pending.

- **Confirmed (slice129):** separate fresh --probes generation changes only D5:
  exactly two27-byte statements at intended pre/return frontiers. All327 other
  files, including registry/header, match frozen116 byte-for-byte. Independent
  removal of the two lines restores D5 exactly; baseline producer gates unchanged.
- **Confirmed:** changed D5 compiles with qualified Clang/VS ABI. Producer CTest1/1
  and Python141/141, zero skips, reuse128 native fixtures. No full probed library,
  lifecycle/runtime adapter, new game executable or live capture yet.

- **Confirmed (slice130):** optional fixture-only adapter observes actual runtime
  probes, preserves original shape inputs across a synthetic handler dispatched
  exactly once, and invalidates tokens through real kernel lifecycle/load paths.
  Three pinned source overlays invert exactly to donor bytes after removing hooks.
- **Confirmed:** fresh Clang build, CTest5/5 and Python147/147, zero skips.
  Unoverlaid/observed controls emit identical46,036-byte defined-field transcripts.
  Link-map/COFF gates select reviewed direct EE bindings; game link excludes hooks.
  Extra headers and post-configure source edits reject before altered compilation.
- **Unknown:** retail call reachability, full probed-library/game linkage, geometry
  and live scheduling/overhead. Owner session unchanged; no performance probe or
  drawing replacement. See [Observation](SCENE-OBSERVATION.md).

See [EE Producer](EE-PRODUCER.md), [Render Contracts](RENDER-CONTRACTS.md) and
[Callback Coverage](EE-CALLBACK-COVERAGE.md), with [slice 116](inputs/slice116-ee-producer-contracts.json)
and [slice 117 evidence](inputs/slice117-ee-entry-coverage.json), for build/test
results and remaining gates. [EE Candidates](EE-CANDIDATES.md) and
[Car Asset Research](CAR-ASSET-RESEARCH.md) cover slice 118. P0/P1 remain **in
progress**: [Nenkai References](NENKAI-REFERENCES.md) and
[slice 119 metadata](inputs/slice119-nenkai-assets.json) record subsequent catalogue
progress. [Volume Reader](VOLUME-READER.md) and [slice 120 metadata](inputs/slice120-car-identity.json)
record the selected extraction and offline identity; candidate gameplay, remaining entry coverage and one real car's
data/conventions are pending. Production library, default launcher and runtime
have not been replaced. Candidate checks do not qualify game boot or racing.
See [Model Asset Probe](MODEL-ASSET-PROBE.md) and
[slice 121 metadata](inputs/slice121-model-file-map.json) for the now-confirmed
offline file mapping and exact header-only parsing boundary. P1 remains open.
[Model Records](MODEL-RECORDS.md) and
[slice 122 metadata](inputs/slice122-shape-records.json) extend this to fixed
record and declared packet-span inventory; renderable geometry remains pending.
[VIF Framing](VIF-FRAMING.md) and [slice 123 metadata](inputs/slice123-vif-framing.json)
record conditional framing, corrected source assumptions and remaining live-state gates.
[Static VIF State Contract](VIF-STATE-CONTRACT.md) and
[slice 124 metadata](inputs/slice124-vif-state-contract.json) record submission
effects, buffered cycle words and the boundary before raw lane/geometry decoding.
[Raw Channel Lanes](RAW-CHANNEL-LANES.md) and
[slice 125 metadata](inputs/slice125-raw-channel-lanes.json) extend this to
controlled raw integer inputs, with channel/topology/geometry gates still open.
[Channel Selection Audit](CHANNEL-SELECTION-AUDIT.md) and
[slice 126 metadata](inputs/slice126-channel-selection.json) record reference
coverage gaps before any semantic converter or native car renderer is adopted.
The owner's active OpenCode baseline session was preserved during build qualification.
On the owner's subsequent explicit request, it closed normally and the slice 118
baseline candidate launched at 13:16 local time. Its window responded and module
loading progressed; owner gameplay confirmation remains pending. The existing
card, normal session locks and per-session backup were used. This startup
observation does not qualify racing or performance. Recovered remains unlaunched.

## Active Path

`native/` + MIT ps2-web-recomp runtime frozen at
1b4808793a12c45125262fd2d5f50a9ec9f7c020. EE translated AOT to x86-64,
IOP/VU interpreted, and PS2 hardware/services modeled in software. Vulkan compute,
Win32, WinMM, and XInput. Does not use a browser, WebAssembly, or embedded PCSX2.

Earlier pre-donor work was removed from this repository and lives in the private
`gt4-staticrecomp-legacy` repository. Private data, saves, and frozen producers remain local.

## Confirmed Results and Limits

- Boot/menus, car/track selection, and genuine Nürburgring racing gameplay; limited 9,000-frame automated controls.
- In-game 16:9 camera/HUD and default 16:9 window framing; 4:3 optional.
- Owner manually tested 480i/480p/1080i during gameplay, all in 16:9; 480p subjectively
  most stable. Human functional confirmation without independent proof of scan fields.
- 48 kHz stereo PCM delivered to Windows; buffer underrun/continuity issues remain open.
- XInput/analog/rumble implementation covered by test fixtures; physical controller hardware untested.
- Persistent memory card, profile/settings saved by the game, per-session backup, and mutual exclusion lock.

Severe performance and frametime degradation recorded: 19 FPS in-race, 11 FPS in 3D car showroom,
18 FPS / 72.5 ms in 1080i screenshot; overlay metrics are not independently calibrated.
Keyboard arrow keys produced double-movements per keystroke per owner report; other keys
remain suspect. Slice136 removes the confirmed dual digital/analog keyboard mapping;
live menu/steering confirmation remains pending. The prior record-only performance restriction is now
superseded for an owner-delegated OpenCode investigation; Codex prepares context only.
The owner separately authorized this keyboard correction. Gameplay is owner-controlled: no Computer Use,
GUI automation, simulated input or scripted navigation. Manual play window and memory card are untouched
by this cleanup. CPU/GPU fidelity, CFC2(28), temporal deinterlacing, 100% realtime rate,
prolonged stability, completed full races, and broad save scenarios remain open qualification items.

## Build and Verification

The root build now only covers the current Clang/C++20 pipeline, generated by
`native/build.cmd` into `private/slice114-native-base/`. Runtime 113 and nine original SPIR-V
shaders remain preserved. The private AOT library is a prerequisite,
validated by hash; the playable build does not yet consume the separate P0 producer.
Clean build with zero warnings; 3/3 CTest passing in 11.13s, 32 Python tests passing without skips (final rerun in 5.812s).
A 120-frame headless smoke test exits cleanly with memory card duplication,
without navigating or launching a new race. All 9 SPIR-V shaders match slice 113; frozen pins preserved.
The original 54 CTest / 117 Python tests are historical: tests for the removed engine reside
on the archive branch; the active test suite covers the surviving codebase.

## Native Port Direction

Historical scene-renderer direction below is deferred on the slice 141 hybrid
branch. Use [Hybrid Port Plan](HYBRID-PORT-PLAN.md) for the active next task.

The owner requested a comprehensive native-renderer/native-port and multi-model plan:
[Native Port Plan](NATIVE-PORT-PLAN.md), [Agent Workflow](AGENT-WORKFLOW.md).
Initial target selected by owner: Windows, entry-level dedicated GPU, internal
1920x1080 at 60 FPS. Exact hardware/preset and achieved throughput remain Unknown.
Owner clarified that deferred rendering and a graphical remaster are outside the
current roadmap. Native graphics, progressive output, configurable internal
resolution, ultrawide and independent simulation/presentation timing remain goals.

The owner authorized reproducible EE generation and bounded model/camera research
in slice 116; slice 117 qualifies one callback recovery mechanism offline. The
planned following stage is one live showroom car drawn through a game-level
Vulkan renderer. Expand to racing, progressive/internal resolution and temporal
separation; retire all graphics paths, then remaining execution/device dependencies
through separate qualified service/core migrations. AOT alone does not mean zero
emulation. No Windows JIT is active today; the proposed port does not introduce one.

The new plan supersedes the phase order of [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), whose timing
analysis remains useful. Eliminating IOP/VU models is not a prerequisite for
FPS independence; 144 distinct scenes require qualified visual state/hooks.
Plans include economical worker routing, independent review, serial integration
and owner-operated gameplay gates. No workers, provider setup or recurring jobs
were dispatched outside the read-only planning review.

This revision is documentation only: no renderer/code generation implementation,
profiling, build, game run or new qualification result. Existing OpenCode changes
and the owner's session/card are preserved. Input, audio, save and stability work
continues to require its own authorized package and acceptance controls.

Technical reference: [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md), [Build](BUILD.md),
[Slice 114 Report](reverse-engineering/slice114-native-base-cleanup.md).
Prior functional evidence: reports 110–113, corresponding manifests, and
`inputs/slice113-owner-results.json`. Slice 114 does not reclassify these results
as complete fidelity proofs or official benchmarks.

README updated for public presentation: project vision, confirmed features,
experimental boundaries, and future goals. Editorial change only; does not alter
runtime, requirements, priorities, or validation results.

## OpenCode Performance Handoff

The owner requested an investigation prompt, not debugging by Codex.
[Task prompt](OPENCODE-PERFORMANCE-HANDOFF.md) provides verified paths, build and
launcher constraints, hypotheses to test, fresh producer/manifest requirements,
manual feedback iterations and save protection. Initial source baseline is
cbccf80; executing agent must recheck HEAD. No profiling, build or game run occurred
while preparing this handoff. Maintain documentation and new comments in en-US.

**Round 2 (same day):** launcher `49d25309...` and owner installer `private\slice243-installer\GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.0-test.exe`
(28,771,288 bytes, sha256 `92666e14386d92fa5098f69a0aab4ae452c1e8978e3329abfd606ed606f0e585`). Adds: monitor names
without resolution, Resolution default "desktop" (follows the desktop at each start), every gt4-gs value enabled, the
renderer choice in setup and the GSdx switch in Settings, the GSdx naming, and PR #72 (TASK-089) merged.
