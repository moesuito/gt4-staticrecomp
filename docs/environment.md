# Environment audit — 2026-09-09

Latest implementation update: M4 on 2026-09-19 adds native zlib 1.3.1 via
hash-pinned CMake FetchContent. The archive can be supplied offline with
GT4_ZLIB_ARCHIVE; sources/build products stay in ignored build directories.
MSVC Debug build, 3 CTest entries and 24 Python tests pass locally. Ghidra 12.1.3
imports our native analysis ELF and verifies payloads/zero-fill. Its temporary
project location and remaining R5900 decoding limitation are in the M4 lesson.

| Component | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Git | 2.51.0.windows.1; workspace initially had no `.git` repository |
| CMake | 4.1.2 |
| Ninja | 1.13.2 |
| MSVC | 19.44.35215, x64, VS 2022 Build Tools |
| LLVM | `clang++` and `clang-cl` found; not selected/tested |
| Python | 3.14.3; optional for analysis, not needed for M0 |
| Java | Oracle JDK 26.0.2.1, 64-bit; explicit `java -version` succeeded; not on PATH |
| Ghidra | 12.1.3 confirmed from installation properties at the owner-supplied location |
| PCSX2 | 2.8.2.0 confirmed from executable metadata at `C:/Program Files/PCSX2/pcsx2-qt.exe` |
| ImHex | Not located in initial PATH/common-directory audit; installation unknown |

No applications were installed. The audit did not search every drive.
MSVC is selected for the first build because an x64 toolchain is already
available. Use Developer PowerShell so compiler, linker, and Windows SDK paths
are configured together.

Ghidra's official prebuilt-install instructions currently specify a 64-bit
JDK 21; its source-build requirements differ. Verify the selected release's
instructions when installing rather than freezing the charter's release number.
See [official installation instructions](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra#install).

Ghidra launcher: `C:/Users/niket/OneDrive/Desktop/ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC/ghidraRun.bat`.
Java executable: `C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-26.0.2.1/bin/java.exe`.
The installed Ghidra properties specify Java minimum 21 and no maximum; launch
compatibility with this JDK has not been tested in this session. PCSX2 debugger
capture is likewise not yet functionally validated. ImHex remains unlocated.

Build validation: fresh CMake configure, Ninja build, and CTest succeeded with
MSVC x64; 2/2 tests passed. The first configure failed with `kernel32.lib` missing
because the shell lacked a complete SDK library environment. Loading Visual
Studio Developer PowerShell and reconfiguring with `cmake --fresh` resolved it.
No source changes or installations were required to fix that environment issue.

If the normal shell has the compiler but lacks the SDK paths, initialize it:

```powershell
Import-Module 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/BuildTools/Common7/Tools/Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll'
Enter-VsDevShell -VsInstallPath 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/BuildTools' -SkipAutomaticLocation -DevCmdArguments '-arch=x64 -host_arch=x64'
```

Then use the README build commands. If a failed configure already created a
cache, add `--fresh` to the configure command once.

## M2 tooling update — 2026-09-13

Created ignored `private/tooling-venv/` using the existing Python 3.14.3 and
installed pycdlib 1.20.0 there for ISO observation. The package is pinned in
`scripts/requirements.txt`. This does not change global Python or the C++ build.
12 standalone Python tests and real-disc manifest verification passed.

## M6 decoder re-verification tooling — 2026-10-01

Decoder coverage was expanded on this machine and independently re-verified.
Ghidra 12.1.3 (official asset `ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC_20260817.zip`, SHA-256
`93a5d11a9ad510622acaaf908c556a7b9b764d338e78a7567f3689bf5081fd54`, matching
the published checksum) and Eclipse Temurin JDK 21.0.12.1+1 (Ghidra 12.1's
minimum is JDK 21) were extracted as ignored local tooling under
`private/tooling/`; no machine-wide installation or PATH change was made.
`JAVA_HOME` is set per command. The comparison landed at
`M6_COMPARISON matched=417 non_nop=352 unsupported=71 mismatched=0`. The first
run reported nine mismatches, all Ghidra aliases; the two missing explicit
expansions (clear, one-operand jalr) are now documented in the M6 evidence doc.
