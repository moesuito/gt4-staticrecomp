# Controls: input bindings file (GT4_CONTROLS_FILE)

Status: implemented for Windows (slice 179, TASK-029, release 1.0.0 workstream W3). The launcher
(W5) writes the file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp\controls.toml` and sets `GT4_CONTROLS_FILE` on
the game process. Unset means the built-in bindings, which are the same as before this change.

Labels: **Confirmed** (in code or tests), **Hypothesis** (not yet tested on hardware), **Unknown**.

**slice210 (TASK-075/076):** the pad backend is SDL3 3.4.18 (`GT4_INPUT=sdl`, the default; `GT4_INPUT=xinput` keeps the
XInput path for one release). The file format is unchanged: the `xinput:` source names name the physical positions
and drive every pad. The built-in keyboard keys changed to the TASK-076 layout (section `keyboard-default`). See
`docs/INPUT-SDL3.md`.

## What the file does

The PS2 pad has 16 digital inputs and 4 analog sticks. Each logical input lists the host sources
that drive it. A source is an XInput control or a keyboard key. Pressure-sensitive buttons
(the PS2 pressure set: D-pad, face, shoulder, L2 and R2) take their pressure from analog sources. Digital sources give full pressure (255).

- **Confirmed:** LT and RT drive L2 and R2 with analog pressure by default, as before. Each
  trigger sets the digital bit above its deadzone and the pressure from the value above it.
- **Confirmed:** keyboard keys are digital and cannot drive sticks.
- **Confirmed:** the defaults reproduce the slice 157 mapping bit for bit (checked over all 256
  trigger values and all 65,536 values of each stick axis, see Tests).

## Format

TOML subset, UTF-8. Comments start with `#` outside quotes. Strings use double quotes and cannot
contain `"`. No escapes, no multi-line values, no dotted keys, no inline tables.

```toml
schema = 1                     # required; must be exactly 1

[bindings]                     # the only table
cross = ["xinput:A", "key:Z"]  # one array of sources per input
l2 = ["xinput:LT | deadzone=0.05"]
rstick_y = []                  # an empty list unbinds the input
```

Rules:

1. `schema = 1` is required. Any other value is refused.
2. Only the `[bindings]` table exists. Any other table is refused.
3. Each key in `[bindings]` is an input name (table below). A name may appear once.
4. Inputs you list replace their defaults. Inputs you do not list keep their defaults. Use `[]`
   to unbind an input.
5. A value is a one-line array of quoted sources, or a single quoted source (`cross = "key:Z"`).
6. Duplicate sources on one input are refused.

Errors name the file and line: `C:\...\controls.toml:7: unknown XInput source 'Q'`. The game does
not start with an invalid file: the window stage stops with `[controls] invalid controls file,
game not started: ...` and exit code 1.

## Inputs

| Name | PS2 meaning | Kind | Default XInput | Default key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dpad_up`, `dpad_right`, `dpad_down`, `dpad_left` | D-pad | digital | DpadUp, DpadRight, DpadDown, DpadLeft | Up+E, Right+D, Down, Left+A |
| `cross`, `circle`, `square`, `triangle` | face buttons | digital, pressure | A, B, X, Y | W+Enter, Space, S, Backspace+Esc |
| `l1`, `r1` | shoulders | digital, pressure | LB, RB | Q, Shift |
| `l2`, `r2` | triggers | digital, pressure | LT, RT (analog) | F, R |
| `l3`, `r3` | stick clicks | digital | LThumb, RThumb | none |
| `select`, `start` | Select, Start | digital | Back, Start | C+Tab, P (start: hypothesis) |
| `rstick_x`, `rstick_y` | right stick | axis | RX, RY (invert=true on Y) | none |
| `lstick_x`, `lstick_y` | left stick | axis | LX, LY (invert=true on Y) | none |

The XInput names are positions (SDL 3.4.18, `docs/INPUT-SDL3.md`): `A` is the bottom face button (Cross on a
PlayStation pad), `B` the right, `X` the left, `Y` the top.

Stick and trigger sources are listed below. A stick input accepts only stick sources; a button
input accepts button, trigger and key sources.

## Sources

| Source | Kind | Drives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xinput:A`, `B`, `X`, `Y` | XInput face button | button inputs |
| `xinput:LB`, `RB` | shoulder button | button inputs |
| `xinput:Back`, `Start` | menu buttons | button inputs |
| `xinput:LThumb`, `RThumb` | stick click | button inputs |
| `xinput:DpadUp`, `DpadDown`, `DpadLeft`, `DpadRight` | D-pad | button inputs |
| `xinput:LT`, `xinput:RT` | trigger, 0..255 | button inputs, with pressure |
| `xinput:LX`, `LY`, `RX`, `RY` | stick axis, -32768..32767 | stick inputs only |
| `key:<name>` | keyboard key | button inputs only |

Key names (case-insensitive): `A`..`Z`, `0`..`9`, `F1`..`F12`, `Num0`..`Num9`, `Enter`,
`Backspace`, `Tab`, `Space`, `Shift`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Esc`, `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`,
`Insert`, `Delete`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`.

Reserved (refused in a file): `F7`, `F8`, `F9`, `F11`. The host uses them for the performance probe
and fullscreen. Alt+Enter toggles fullscreen; while Alt is held, Enter is not Start.

## Options

Options follow the source after a `|`, separated by spaces: `"xinput:LT | deadzone=0.05 curve=quadratic"`.

| Option | Applies to | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deadzone` | triggers, sticks | 0 up to, not including, 1; fraction of full travel | trigger 30/255 (0.1176); right stick 8689/32767; left stick 7849/32767 |
| `scale` | triggers, sticks | 0 to 2; multiplies the curve output, clamped to full travel | 1 |
| `curve` | triggers, sticks | `linear`, `quadratic`, `cubic`, `s_curve`, `smooth_power`, `sublinear`, `logarithmic` | `linear` |
| `invert` | sticks only | `true` or `false` | `false` |

Digital sources (`xinput:A` etc. and `key:` sources) take no options.

SDL3 Gamepad triggers already use 0 released through 32767 pressed for Xbox and DualSense alike.
The adapter reduces that standardized value to a pressure byte; raw joystick/HID signed ranges are
not read here. No device-name range override or `mode` source option is supported.

Reading rules, as implemented in `native/controls.cpp`:

- **Trigger:** raw value `v`, deadzone `d` (raw units, rounded). Digital bit set when `v > d`. With
  linear and scale 1: `pressure = (v - d) * 255 / (255 - d)`, integer division (the slice 157 formula).
  Otherwise `pressure = floor(min(1, curve(n) * scale) * 255)`, where `n = (v - d) / (255 - d)`.
- **Stick:** the sign of the raw value sets the travel range (32768 below zero, 32767 above), as
  before. `invert` flips the direction. Output is the PS2 byte: 128 at rest, 0..255 across travel.
- **Several sources on one input:** buttons OR together, and the highest pressure wins. On a stick,
  the reading furthest from rest wins.

## Example files

Shipped in `docs/controls/` and checked by `controls_fixture` (CTest `native_controls`) and
`test_controls_probe.py`.

- `default.toml`: the built-in mapping, written out in full. It parses to exactly the built-in map.
- `keyboard-only.toml`: all 16 buttons on the keyboard (WASD for the D-pad, J/K/H/U face buttons),
  sticks unbound. Use it when no controller is connected.
- `triggers-as-pedals.toml`: L2 and R2 from LT and RT with a 0.05 deadzone, everything else default.
  Use it with the in-game accelerate/brake assignment described in the owner test below.

## Launcher contract (W5)

- Write the file yourself; the game only reads it. Set `GT4_CONTROLS_FILE` to its absolute path on
  the game process. Do not set it in the system or user environment.
- Validate first. `scripts/external_runtime_probe.py` refuses a bad file before any run output
  exists (`--controls PATH`, or `controls_file=` in `play()`). The Python check covers the TOML
  shape, the schema, input names and source kinds. The C++ reader applies the full rules.
- `result.json` records the bindings in force:
  `"controls": {"source": "default"}` or
  `"controls": {"source": "file", "path": "...", "size_bytes": N, "sha256": "..."}`.
- An empty or unset `GT4_CONTROLS_FILE` means the built-in bindings. An inherited value is cleared
  for every probe run, so a stale variable cannot change the bindings.

### What the launcher's Controls page writes (TASK-019, 2026-10-21)

The format above is unchanged. The page writes the whole file after every change (no Save), always in
the order of the Inputs table, and keeps the old file when a change is refused or the write fails.

- **Rebind:** the new source replaces the button's source of the same family (`xinput:` or `key:`);
  the other family stays. A trigger that replaces a trigger keeps its options.
- **Conflict:** a source already on another button is not bound twice. Swap gives the other button
  the previous source of that family (or removes the source there when there was none).
- **Trigger rows:** `deadzone=` (0 to 0.95) and `curve=` on the `xinput:LT`/`xinput:RT` source of L2
  and R2.
- **Stick rows:** `deadzone=` (0 to 0.95) on every axis source of both axes of a stick; `invert` and
  the other options are kept. Example: `lstick_y = ["xinput:LY | invert=true deadzone=0.100"]`.
- **Reset all:** the built-in mapping, options included.
- A file written by a newer launcher (unknown schema) is kept as it is and the page is read-only.

## keyboard-default

The built-in keyboard keys (TASK-076, slice210). Hard-coded: they are the defaults of `native/controls.cpp`
(`default_controls`) and of `docs/controls/default.toml`, and the launcher shows them read-only. Keys are digital (full
pressure). F7, F8, F9 and F11 belong to the host and are not used.

```json
{
  "keyboard-default": {
    "dpad_up": ["Up", "E"],
    "dpad_right": ["D", "Right"],
    "dpad_down": ["Down"],
    "dpad_left": ["A", "Left"],
    "cross": ["W", "Enter"],
    "circle": ["Space"],
    "square": ["S"],
    "triangle": ["Backspace", "Esc"],
    "l1": ["Q"],
    "r1": ["Shift"],
    "l2": ["F"],
    "r2": ["R"],
    "l3": [],
    "r3": [],
    "select": ["C", "Tab"],
    "start": ["P"]
  }
}
```

Meaning: D-pad left and right also run on A and D; cross is accelerate and confirm; circle is handbrake; square brake;
triangle back; L1 look back; R1 nitro; L2 gear down; R2 gear up; select the camera. `start` = P is a hypothesis
pending the owner's choice (the table gives no Start key; Enter is Cross). Evidence and confidence: `docs/INPUT-SDL3.md`.

## Limits

- **Confirmed:** only the windowed path reads the file (`open_window`). A headless run (`--frames`
  without `--window`) never polls a controller; the file is not read there.
- **Confirmed (slice210):** SDL3 is the gamepad backend (`GT4_INPUT=sdl`, default; `xinput` keeps the XInput path for one
  release). DualShock 4, DualSense and Switch Pro pads are read through SDL's mapping; tested on the owner's pads only.
- **Confirmed:** no hot reload. Change the file, then start the game again.
- **Confirmed:** the rumble motors follow the same motor values on both backends and are not configurable here.
- **Hypothesis:** GT4 reads L2/R2 pressure and sticks only in the modes its menus choose. The file
  cannot change what the game does with a pressure or stick value it does not read. See the owner
  test below.
- **Unknown:** whether GT4 stores its own controller assignment on the memory card. This file
  does not change the card.

## Owner test (controller)

Run with the default file first, then with `triggers-as-pedals.toml`.

1. Start the window with no `GT4_CONTROLS_FILE`. Check that the log shows `[controls] default bindings`.
2. Move the sticks in the game menus. Check that the cursor follows the left stick and that the
   right stick Y reads as up/down in the same way as before (Y is inverted by default).
3. Press Cross, Circle, Square, Triangle, L1, R1, Start and Select. Each should register as before.
4. Hold LT and RT halfway and fully. Note whether the game reacts to pressure (accelerate or
   brake strength) after the in-game assignment (see step 6).
5. Start the probe with `triggers-as-pedals.toml` (`--controls` on `scripts\play_performance.py` or
   `GT4_CONTROLS_FILE` in the environment). Check that the log shows the file path and `result.json`
   records the sha256.
6. In the game's controller options, assign accelerate to R2 and brake to L2, as the owner did in
   PCSX2. Confirm throttle and brake respond in proportion to the trigger travel. Report what you see
   This is the open question the owner test answers; record the result in the journal.
7. Edit the file to break it (for example `cross = ["xinput:Q"]`). Start the window and check that
   the game does not start and the log shows the file, line and reason.
