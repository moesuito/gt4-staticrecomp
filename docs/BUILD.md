# Current Path Build Guide

Slice142 adds host-only `perf_accounting_fixture` to CTest. It uses authored
timestamps and requires no game/input/performance run. It does not replace the
player's probe or runtime. See [attribution qualification](PERFORMANCE-ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Qualified Environment

Windows x86-64, VS2022 Build Tools / SDK 10.0.26100.0, clang-cl 23.1.2,
CMake 3.24+, Ninja, Rust/Cargo with Cargo.lock, and Naga 30.0.0.
Local Python in `private/tooling-venv` with `scripts/requirements.txt`
(pycdlib 1.20.0). The qualified GPU is an RTX 3060 Laptop; the backend requires Vulkan 1.2
and swapchain maintenance1. There is no evidence of full Khronos conformance validation.

`native/build.cmd` initializes the VS x64 environment and sets UTF-8 encoding prior to invoking CMake.

## Private Prerequisites

| Location | Role |
|---|---|
| `private/references/ps2-web-recomp` | MIT donor at commit 1b4808793a12c45125262fd2d5f50a9ec9f7c020 |
| `private/reference-acceleration-study/runtime-build/ps2game.lib` | Ahead-of-time (AOT) game library, SHA256 `c837d13dae027f377aecdb0c39834ede2e9463eabf7f767fda6a3c5a0762de1f` |
| `private/reference-acceleration-study/generated` | 326 C++ EE compilation units and registry that produced this library |
| `private/tooling/pcsx2-slice101-source/3rdparty/vulkan/include` | Khronos headers; no PCSX2 implementation code is linked |
| `private/tooling-venv/Scripts/python.exe` | Python virtual environment |
| Root ISO, `private/fingerprint-check/CORE.GT4`, `private/reconstructed/SCUS_973.28.elf` | Hash-pinned inputs in `docs/inputs` |
| Private slice 110/113 seeds | Memory cards derived from the original interface; never distributed |

The build validates the donor adapter sources and rejects an AOT library with a mismatched hash.
The launcher verifies ISO / CORE / ELF / runtime / shaders / card seed before execution.
Pins must not be updated to mask an underlying divergence.

**Reproduction limit:** The [P0 EE producer](EE-PRODUCER.md) now reconstructs the
pinned ELF from verified CORE/ISO input, rebuilds the donor translator and creates
a separate AOT library with fresh CMake caches. It does not yet replace the
production library or automate a clean-checkout playable game build. The ordinary
native build still recompiles runtime/host/adapters and links the existing qualified
library. Keep candidate and production qualification distinct.

Slice 118 adds [isolated baseline/recovered EE builds](EE-CANDIDATES.md) with
separate library/executable manifests and a candidate launcher. The default build
still uses the production pin. Both paths require prepared private assets;
candidate native checks are distinct from owner gameplay qualification.

## Compiling and Verification

From repository root:

```powershell
cmd /c native\build.cmd
ctest --test-dir private/slice114-native-base/build --output-on-failure
```

CTest runs the GPU/Vulkan checks, Windows audio/input tests, and active Python test suite.

Running Python tests standalone, when needed:

```powershell
private/tooling-venv/Scripts/python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests/python
```

Execute builds and tests serially. Linkers may lock binary outputs, and an active manual play
session holds an exclusive lock on the memory card. Do not terminate the owner's active game session unnecessarily.

## Producers and Launcher

This slice outputs adapter / shaders / build artifacts to `private/slice114-native-base/`,
without overwriting producers from slices 111–113. The launcher references
`docs/inputs/slice114-native-base.json`. Publishing a new slice requires successful builds, passing tests,
and verified hashes; compiling modified sources does not authorize repinning the executable.
Future slices must select fresh directories before building and preserve previously accepted
producers. Binaries, SPIR-V files, and generated code remain untracked by Git.

`Jogar-GT4.cmd` manages `private/manual-play/card.ps2`, per-session backups, and exclusive
locking. It never reseeds an existing memory card. When initializing a new card,
it uses the 16:9 or 4:3 seed corresponding to the `--aspect` argument.

## Offline selected-asset research

[Volume Reader](VOLUME-READER.md) documents the bounded, hash-verified
`scripts/gt4_volume.py` command. It needs the tooling Python/pycdlib and owner
ISO, not a native rebuild. It writes only explicit selections to a fresh
ignored capsule and preserves all inputs/pins. Its public synthetic tests are
included automatically in existing Python discovery/CTest. SpecDB parsing in
slice 120 remains a private experiment, not a general supported decoder.

[Model Asset Probe](MODEL-ASSET-PROBE.md) adds a pure `probe_asset(bytes)` header
inventory in slice 121. It consumes separately verified, explicitly extracted
CAR4/MDLS input; no native rebuild or runtime integration. Its public controls
also run in Python discovery/CTest. Model and texture bodies remain unqualified.
Slice122 adds `gt4_model_records.inventory_asset(bytes)` for fixed-record and
packet-span metadata. Its controls use the same discovery; no VIF/pixel decoder
or native build is involved. See [Model Records](MODEL-RECORDS.md).
Slice123's `gt4_vif_framing.frame_packet(bytes, initial_cycle=(CL, WL))` is a
conditional offline scanner, included in existing controls. No live incoming
cycle or VU/channel semantics are qualified. See [VIF Framing](VIF-FRAMING.md).
Slice125's `gt4_raw_lanes.decode_integer_lanes` consumes explicitly framed
ordinary input integers with exact data/alignment spans. Public controls use
the same discovery; it adds no runtime decoder. See [Raw Lanes](RAW-CHANNEL-LANES.md).

Slice128 adds `shape_observer_fixture`, a host-only C++ contract control included
in native CTest and Python discovery. Reconfigure a fresh candidate build to
include the new fourth CTest entry; frozen118 caches do not contain this target.
The fresh128 build uses the existing qualified baseline library and private118
port/shaders. No observer is linked into gt4vulkan. CTest4/4 and Python132/132
pass with no skips. See [Shape Observation](SCENE-OBSERVATION.md) for scope.
Slice129 separately regenerates the exact two-probe source profile and compiles
only changed D5 in a fresh unit-control cache. Producer CTest1/1 runs Python141/141
using128 native fixtures; no full probed-library/runtime build is claimed.
Slice130's optional runtime fixture is enabled with `GT4_SHAPE_RUNTIME_SOURCE`
pointing to a fresh capsule made by `scripts/prepare_shape_observation.py`.
Default is empty. CMake accepts only the reviewed three-source hashes, prevents
shadow headers and rechecks changed private sources before rebuilding. The game
target stays unoverlaid; synthetic observed/reference fixtures exercise runtime
lifecycle and selected guest outputs. Fresh130 CTest5/5/Python147/147, no skips.
This is not a playable probed-library profile. See [Observation](SCENE-OBSERVATION.md).

Slice131 builds the complete two-probe library with the same `tools/ee_producer`
project and translator disabled, in a fresh producer cache. Use
`scripts/ee_observation_library.py prepare --baseline <qualified-baseline>
--profile <qualified129-profile> --output private/<fresh-library-capsule>` first,
then configure/build `ps2game` with the copied generated directory and run
`record-library --output <that-capsule>`. Both commands validate the pinned
baseline and exact probe-only sources; recording also checks all archive members,
the unchanged compiler recipe and D5's independent129 normalized object hash.
Do not reuse frozen131 output or feed this profile to the ordinary null-option
producer recorder. CTest1/1 runs Python155/155 with frozen130 native fixtures;
runtime linkage and owner gameplay remain separate qualification boundaries.

Slice132 adds the opt-in `-DGT4_EE_PROFILE=observation` native profile, together
with `-DGT4_SHAPE_RUNTIME_SOURCE=<fresh-reviewed-overlay-capsule>`. It selects
only the pinned131 library and qualified118 port/shaders. Configure into a fresh
private build directory and build/test serially as usual. The game links the three
overlays and observer directly, preserving the original runtime archive and paired
unoverlaid synthetic control. CMake revalidates library/source changes. A separate
`observation-game.map` records actual application linkage; Python CTest verifies
selected bindings and source/library graph. Fresh132 CTest5/5/Python155/155 passes.
Capture is disabled; there is no activation/export interface or gameplay validation
yet. The normal build command and production launcher still select production.

Slice133 adds `shape_capture_export_fixture` and a serial native CTest entry.
The fixture uses a uniquely created temporary directory with synthetic metadata,
removing its files on success. Python parses the actual three JSON reports.
Reconfigure a fresh native build to include this sixth test; frozen132 caches stay
unchanged. Fresh133 CTest6/6/Python156/156, zero skips. The export component is not
linked into the game and requires no new dependency. Activation/output path
selection and a separate owner-facing capture launcher remain future work.

Slice134 links capture control/export only into the explicit observation profile.
Fresh134 build adds a seventh CTest entry and passes Python164/164 with zero skips.
Baseline graph checks exclude those game objects/macros; production was not rebuilt.
`scripts/play_shape_capture.py --assets-root <owner-assets-checkout>` selects the
qualified134 manifest and reuses the existing manual card/backup/lock flow.
Use the tooling Python and run from the launcher checkout containing the frozen
private134 runtime and118 shaders. Output belongs to the owner-assets checkout's
fresh `private/manual-play/session-.../shape-capture.json`, never a producer capsule.
The native window consumes the explicit `GT4_OBSERVATION_OUTPUT` provided by that
launcher; generic launches clear any inherited value. Invalid/existing native output
fails closed before emulation. Default production launch remains unchanged.
See [manual instructions](SCENE-OBSERVATION.md#owner-controlled-capture-slice134).

The current manual launcher selects the separately qualified136 candidate via
`docs/inputs/slice136-keyboard-input.json`, replacing its active134 selection without
overwriting that frozen build. It includes the minimal keyboard merge correction:
arrows emit digital D-pad only; keyboard never forces analog axes. Fresh136 native
CTest7/7/Python164/164 passes; the unchanged fixture rejects the old merge code.
All seeds/shaders/library pins and save/backup/lock behavior are preserved.
Owner must close the current window normally before launching the corrected build.

Slice143 is a separate performance-only production-EE profile. Prepare fresh
three-source runtime overlays with `scripts/prepare_perf_runtime.py` (see its
`--help`); source hashes must match the clean pinned donor. Configure a fresh
cache with `GT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE` pointing to that immediate private capsule,
`GT4_EE_PROFILE=production`, empty `GT4_SHAPE_RUNTIME_SOURCE`, and
`GT4_PORT_DIR`/`GT4_SHADER_DIR` pointing to the qualified143 port/shaders. The
strict recipe uses `docs/inputs/slice143-performance-runtime.json`; fresh outputs
must be independently pinned before changing that metadata. Do not overwrite143.
Default profile still has no linked probe/hooks. Macro-off observation controls
can separately include shape runtime fixtures; performance and shape profiles
cannot be combined. Candidate native controls7/7 and separate full controls9/9
with Python171/171 pass. This still depends on the private production library,
not an end-to-end clean checkout build. Launch with `scripts/play_performance.py`
and the owner-assets root, using the existing protected manual card flow.
See [measurement instructions](PERFORMANCE-ATTRIBUTION.md#playable-diagnostic-candidate-slice143).

Slice145 reuses the frozen143 sources/port/shaders strictly as shared pinned inputs
and builds into separate fresh145 detailed/control caches. `GT4_PERF_FRAME_ONLY`
defaults OFF; ON requires the performance runtime profile, propagates consistently
to all linked TUs and compiles subsystem scopes/host-operation counters out. Common
frame-boundary telemetry remains, so this is not an entirely uninstrumented build.
The matched native profiles pass7/7 each; separate macro-off observation controls
pass9/9 with Python173/173 zero skips. `scripts/play_performance.py --mode detailed`
(default) or `--mode frame-only`, plus `--assets-root`, selects the corresponding
strictly pinned145 runtime. Existing143 profile validation remains available;
frozen143 caches/binaries/cards are not overwritten. Close sessions normally.

Slice149 adds `prepare_perf_runtime.py <fresh-capsule> --assets-root <assets>
--split-vu` for the dedicated immediate source capsule. Default derivation remains
byte-identical to143. CMake selects149 pins and GT4_PERF_VU_SPLIT only at
private/slice149-vu-split-runtime; frame-only rejected. Fresh149 build reuses frozen
143port/shaders as immutable inputs with production EE. Native7/7 and separate
full9/9 with Python175/175 pass. Explicit `play_performance.py --mode vu-split`
selects149; default detailed/frame-only still select145. See attribution guide.

Slice151 adds an owner-launched VU1 recording mode on the slice149 vu-split binary.
Owner command, from the repository root:

    private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode vu1-record

The mode pins [slice151-vu1-record.json](inputs/slice151-vu1-record.json) to
`private/slice149-vu-split-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`. After the performance
scrub of inherited `PS2_` options, it sets `PS2_VU_RECORD` to a fresh
`vu1-corpus` directory in the session directory and `PS2_VU_COUNT=1`. Stderr
stays in `probe.log`. At exit, `vu1-corpus-summary.json` lists file count, bytes,
per-file sha256, key and entry parsed from names, and rejects any file that is
not exactly 16384 bytes. Card backup, session lock and default modes are
unchanged; default modes never set the recording variables. This is recording
only: no AOT, no timing claim, and the owner controls gameplay.

Slice152 adds asynchronous GS submission (O2) on the slice151 VU1 AOT runtime
capsule. Fresh pins only: adapter `private/slice152-gs-async-port`, shaders
`private/slice152-gs-async-shaders` (the nine unchanged slice143 SPIR-V files),
build `private/slice152-gs-async-build/build`. Splice command, from the repository
root:

    private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\prepare_external_vulkan.py private\slice152-gs-async-port

The build is configured like slice151 with the 152 adapter and shader paths
(`GT4_PORT_DIR`, `GT4_SHADER_DIR`), the slice151 runtime capsule
(`GT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE`) and the generated VU1 table (`GT4_VU1_GENERATED_DIR`).
Runtime pins are [slice152-gs-async-runtime.json](inputs/slice152-gs-async-runtime.json)
(port and shader hashes) and [slice152-gs-async.json](inputs/slice152-gs-async.json)
(launcher). CMake refuses any other port or shader directory on the performance
profile. Owner command: `python scripts/play_performance.py --assets-root . --mode gs-async`.
`GT4_GS_SYNC=1` in the environment restores the synchronous GS path for A/B.

Slice153 adds frame pacing (O4) on the slice152 async build. Fresh pins only: adapter
`private/slice153-pacing-port` and shaders `private/slice153-pacing-shaders` (copies of the
slice152 files, byte-identical), build `private/slice153-pacing-build/build`, runtime capsule
unchanged (`private/slice151-vu1-aot-runtime`). Configure with the slice152 cache values but
`GT4_PORT_DIR` and `GT4_SHADER_DIR` pointing at the slice153 directories; CMake accepts them only
with `GT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE` on the 151 capsule and reads
[slice153-pacing-runtime.json](inputs/slice153-pacing-runtime.json). Launcher pins are
[slice153-pacing.json](inputs/slice153-pacing.json). Owner command, from the repository root:

    private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode pacing

The host paces guest VBlanks on one wall-clock grid at 60 Hz (the donor's `frame_cycles`
is `kEeClock / 60`, NTSC 60.000 Hz, not 59.94). Audio no longer blocks the emulation
thread: 16 x 256-frame WinMM buffers, a 16384-frame ring and a 60 ms (2880-frame) target,
with a linear resampler whose ratio stays within +-0.5 percent under a PI controller. Set
`GT4_PACING=audio` to restore the blocking audio clock of slice152 for A/B. Unknown values
of `GT4_PACING` or `GT4_PRESENT_MODE` are refused by the launcher and by the host.
`GT4_PRESENT_MODE` accepts `fifo` (default), `mailbox` or `immediate` and fails at swapchain
creation when the surface does not support it. Both variables are forwarded unchanged and
recorded as `pacing_environment` in the run result. Headless runs (`--frames`) never enter the
window path, so they are unpaced and their frames are unchanged.

Checks on this build: `native_pacing` (pure fixture), `native_audio_input` (includes a 3 s paced
run on the real device), CTest 18/18, Python 217 OK with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` set to the slice153
build, and 42 identical headless frame dumps against the slice152 build. Owner gameplay
measurement is pending. Diagnostics print in F8 and the periodic report when `GT4_PERF=1`.

Slice154 adds per-program VU1 flag elision on the slice153 pacing build (O1 follow-up). Fresh
pins only: capsule `private/slice154-vu1-flags-runtime` (derived with
`scripts/prepare_perf_runtime.py --vu1-aot`, overlay sha256 in its `runtime.json`), table
`private/slice154-vu1-flags-gen` (generated from `private/slice151-vu1-corpus-union`, 100
programs, 0 refused), build `private/slice154-vu1-flags-build/build`. The adapter and the nine
shaders are the slice153 directories, unchanged. Pins: [slice154-vu1-flags-runtime.json](inputs/slice154-vu1-flags-runtime.json),
[slice154-vu1-flags.json](inputs/slice154-vu1-flags.json). Configure with the slice153 cache values,
`GT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE` and `GT4_VU1_GENERATED_DIR` pointing at the slice154 directories, and
`GT4_VU_CORPUS_DIR` at the corpus. Regenerate the table with
`gt4_vu_recomp <corpus> <fresh_dir>`; `--no-flag-elision` (and `--namespace NAME`) emit the donor
behaviour for comparison. Owner command, from the repository root:

    private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode vu1-flags

`--vu1-verify N` and `--vu1-interpret-only` apply as in the vu1-aot and pacing modes. The
pacing environment variables (`GT4_PACING`, `GT4_PRESENT_MODE`) are unchanged.

What changes. The emitter computes MAC only where a later reader or the program exit can see
it. A MAC reader sees a write only at distance 4 or more with no later write before it, and
clip readers at distance 3 or more (FlagPipe windows). The exit state stays exact: `r.mac` and
`r.clip` are written back at every exit. VU1 status is not computed when the image has no
status instruction (0x14-0x17 and FSSET 0x15). CFC2 reads VU0 registers only, so the EE cannot
observe VU1 status; the corpus image has no such instruction. The clip word is a chain through
every CLIP instruction (`clip_value` reads the previous clip), so clip values are always
computed and only the FlagPipe pushes are elided. Programs with an end bit in a branch delay
slot are refused: the donor runs the target once more and then ends.

Evidence on this build (Confirmed unless marked):

- Sites, 100 programs of the corpus: 6,024 flag-setting writes. Before: 6,024 MAC computations
  with status and 6,024 FlagPipe pushes. After: 642 MAC computations (170 pushed for readers,
  472 for the exit state only) and no status. 607 CLIP writes compute their chain value; 403
  are pushed (was 607). Manifests: `private/slice154-vu1-flags-gen/manifest.json` (mac_mode,
  mac_writers, mac_sites, mac_reader_sites, clip_*).
- Micro-benchmark `gt4_vu1_flag_bench` (CTest does not run it): 200 seeded states (100
  programs, 2 seeds, 4,000-instruction budget). Both tables leave the same status, resume PC,
  registers and VU1 memory (200 compared, 0 failures). Timed: the 68 states that exhaust the
  budget inside generated code (the other 132 leave through an interpreter hand-off and are
  not timed). Two runs: 9,972 and 10,044 ns per call before, 4,681 and 4,674 after; ratio 0.47.
  Random states, not recorded gameplay: an estimate of the direction, not of the showroom time.
- CTest: see the journal entry. Corpus differential 208 checks, 0 failures (100 programs). Fixture
  differential 907 checks, 0 failures, with 40 budget exits resumed in the interpreter.
- Headless smoke: 4,200 frames, the slice153 schedule (12 presses), no window: 42 frame dumps
  identical to [slice153-smoke](../private/slice153-smoke/headless-153.frames.sha256) (run
  `private/slice154-smoke/final-headless`).
- Headless verify: `GT4_VU1_VERIFY=1` on the same schedule, every VU1 call compared with the
  interpreter: see the journal entry for the counters and mismatch count. Frames identical to
  the smoke run.

Limits. Owner gameplay is not measured; the O1 target (showroom VU1 time) is not claimed. The
known limit of the AOT path stays: an interpreter hand-off or a budget resume does not carry
the FlagPipe history, so a MAC or clip read within four instructions after the hand-off can
differ from an uninterrupted run. Random seeds reach the end of a VU1 program rarely, so the
benchmark uses the budget as the workload. Build outputs and card seeds are not committed.

Slice155 (TASK-008) gives the VU1 AOT table full static entry coverage on the slice154
flag-elision profile. No gameplay recording is needed for the table. Owner command, from the
repository root:

    private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode vu1-full

`--vu1-verify N` and `--vu1-interpret-only` apply as in vu1-flags. Pins:
[slice155-vu1-image.json](inputs/slice155-vu1-image.json) (static image),
[slice155-vu1-full-runtime.json](inputs/slice155-vu1-full-runtime.json) (runtime capsule, receipt
identical to slice154) and [slice155-vu1-full.json](inputs/slice155-vu1-full.json) (launcher).
Build directory `private/slice155-vu1-full-build/build`; table `private/slice155-vu1-full-gen`;
capsule `private/slice155-vu1-full-runtime`. The adapter and the nine shaders are the slice153
directories, unchanged.

Steps. All outputs are generated offline in fresh private directories and are not committed.

1. `scripts\vu1_image.py build --elf private\reconstructed\SCUS_973.28.elf --corpus private\slice151-vu1-corpus-union --out private\slice155-vu1-image`
   decrypts the blob (file offset 0x525DD0, length 0x3FF0; keystream in
   [VU1-MICROCODE-SOURCE](VU1-MICROCODE-SOURCE.md)), appends the 16 tail bytes from the snapshots
   (all 86 agree: zeros) and refuses any snapshot that differs. `check --image` verifies the pin.
2. `scripts\vu1_image.py entries --image private\slice155-vu1-image\vu1_image.bin --policy targeted --table-manifest private\slice154-vu1-flags-gen\manifest.json --out private\slice155-vu1-image\entries-targeted.txt`
   writes the entry list (426 addresses).
3. `gt4_vu_recomp --image private\slice155-vu1-image\vu1_image.bin --entries private\slice155-vu1-image\entries-targeted.txt private\slice155-vu1-full-gen`
   emits the table. Explicit mode: `--image` and `--entries` replace the corpus directory. All
   safety gates are unchanged (identity digest, budget and resume, flag elision with the
   image-wide status and MAC rules, collision refusal). The manifest records `input`, the image and
   entry-list hashes, `entry_count`, `function_count` and `generated_bytes`.
4. `scripts\vu1_image.py corpus --image ... --entries ... --out private\slice155-vu1-full-corpus`
   writes one KEY_ENTRY.bin per entry for the corpus differential. The emitter re-derives every key
   in corpus mode and refuses a mismatch. The corpus-mode table equals the explicit table (426
   identical key, entry and digest rows).
5. Runtime capsule: `scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py private\slice155-vu1-full-runtime --vu1-aot`.
   The overlay hash is now computed over LF-normalized text, because a CRLF checkout
   (core.autocrlf) stores the same overlay with other bytes. The pinned receipt is unchanged
   (84eed2a3...). The overlay itself is not changed.

Entry policy decision. Numbers are Confirmed: each table was compiled standalone with the native
flags (clang-cl /O2 /Ob2 -std:c++20).

| Policy | Entries | Generated source | Size vs slice154 table (2,361,045 bytes) | Compile | Object |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| slice154 table (recorded and derived) | 100 | 2,361,045 bytes | 1x | 14.1 s | 1.8 MB |
| (b) targeted, chosen | 426 | 10,226,016 bytes | 4.3x | 65.0 s | 8.5 MB |
| (a) every 8-byte address | 2,048 | 51,532,190 bytes | 21.8x | 400 s (6 min 40 s) | 44.6 MB |

Policy (a) exceeds the 3x source-size limit of the decision rule, so the targeted policy is used.
Its compile time was measured only to report it; it is under 10 minutes. The targeted entries are:
address 0; the address after each E-bit delay slot (pc+16); every branch target; the continuation
of JAL and JALR (pc+16); every IADDIU constant with base vi0 (the donor emitter's rule for JR and
JALR targets); the address after each branch or jump delay slot; and the 100 slice154 entries.
Python `targeted_entries` implements the rules, and tests cover each rule on an authored image. The
set contains all 100 slice154 entries and all 86 recorded entries.

Results (Confirmed unless marked; candidate, not owner-measured):

- Image: `vu1_image.bin` sha256 9e5bc860...796cdff; blob sha256 ae6b6cb3...ac4c1; 86 of 86 snapshots equal the blob over 0x0000-0x3FEF.
- Table: 426 programs, 426 emitted, 0 refused, 0 interpreter exit sites, `image_status_used` false, `mac_mode` observed in every program. Generated source sha256 d65474f8bec2da541fb45d63ed7149440531debdc6acfeca6b11c2d211f831ec (recorded in the launcher pin); manifest sha256 6c69f522730acaec8bf13cab7361f8329c94740d55b4e71db5be505646e42863.
- Coverage: 100 of 100 slice154 entries and 86 of 86 recorded entries are in the entry list. The 100 slice154 entries keep their key and identity digest (Python control).
- CTest 18/18 on the candidate build (46.5 s). Core emitter: 110 checks, 0 failures. Registry (`vu1_aot_registry`): 426 of 426 entries, 2,130 checks, 0 failures. `vu_recomp_corpus` over the 426-file corpus: 426 programs matched, 1,150 checks, 0 failures (181 compared to the end, 1,523 budget-capped and resumed).
- Python: 231 OK, 1 skipped (pre-existing), with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` on the slice155 build. New `tests/python/test_vu1_image.py` has 14 tests: synthetic blobs, plus private controls that skip when the files are absent.
- Candidate build: 103 steps, 3 min 6 s, `gt4vulkan.exe` sha256 3cf5f998...c641d00 (62,204,416 bytes). The build reports about 65,000 `unused label` warnings from the generated code (one label per instruction, as in slice154). They are warnings, not errors.
- Headless smoke, 4,200 frames, the slice153/154 schedule (12 presses), no window: 42 frame dumps identical to `private/slice154-smoke/final-headless/frames.sha256`. Counters at every compiled call: compiled_calls=20002, interpreted_calls=0, budget_resumes=0, identity_rejects=0.
- Headless verify, `GT4_VU1_VERIFY=1`, same schedule: 42 frame dumps identical; verified=4300, verify_mismatches=0, compiled_calls=20002, interpreted_calls=0. The slice154 verify run had the same verified count (4300) at 20,000 calls.

Limits:

1. Coverage is heuristic. The targeted set comes from image structure, not from the EE's MSCAL
   call sites or VIF streams. An entry outside it still runs the interpreter and is counted as
   `interpreted_calls`. The owner scenes (showroom, night race, rally) decide whether this is
   enough; they are not verified here.
2. The schedule only calls slice154 entries (the slice154 verify run logged interpreted_calls=0 on
   the same schedule), so the 326 new entries are not executed in the headless runs. Their
   execution is covered by the corpus differential (426 programs, 0 failures), not by a game run.
3. `verified` counts top-level calls only. Calls made while a verification runs (jump-register
   dispatch and chained hand-offs) run compiled inside both legs and are not compared with the
   interpreter one by one. This predates slice155 and is not changed here.
4. Owner frame measurement is not taken; no speed claim is made. The FlagPipe history limit of
   slice154 is unchanged.

Measurement outputs kept in private directories: `private/slice155-vu1-full-gen-all` (policy a,
51.5 MB, not used), `private/slice155-vu1-full-gen-targeted` (same content as the candidate table),
`private/slice155-smoke/*`.

Slice156 (TASK-009 quick fixes) is a candidate on the slice155 profile. Owner command, from the
repository root:

    private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode quickfix

Changes: window title `GT4Recomp`; the presentation is fixed 16:9 (F6, the 4:3 option and
`GT4_ASPECT` / `--aspect` are removed); Alt+Enter and F11 toggle borderless fullscreen on the
window's monitor and restore the windowed frame (`native/window_mode.*`, fixture
`native/quickfix_fixture.cpp`, CTest `native_quickfix`); the F8 report prints `interval` counter
differences since the last F7 or report next to `session` totals (`Counters::since`, pacing
fixture); `GT4_FORCE_480P=1` (`--force-480p`, default off) rewrites the guest default NTSC request
(SetGsCrt interlace 1, mode 0x2) to 480p progressive (interlace 0, mode 0x50); other modes are
unchanged (`native/display_override.*`; hook in the donor `hw.cpp` `gs_set_crt`).

Pins: [slice156-quickfix-runtime.json](inputs/slice156-quickfix-runtime.json) (capsule receipt;
system, vu_micro and vif sources byte-identical to slice155, `hw.cpp` is the only new source) and
[slice156-quickfix.json](inputs/slice156-quickfix.json) (launcher). Build directory
`private/slice156-quickfix-build/build`; capsule `private/slice156-quickfix-runtime`. The VU1
table `private/slice155-vu1-full-gen`, the adapter and shaders `private/slice153-pacing-port` and
`private/slice153-pacing-shaders` are reused unchanged.

Steps:

1. `scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py private\slice156-quickfix-runtime --vu1-aot --gs-crt-override`
2. Configure with `GT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE=private/slice156-quickfix-runtime`,
   `GT4_VU1_GENERATED_DIR=private/slice155-vu1-full-gen`, `GT4_PORT_DIR` and `GT4_SHADER_DIR` set to
   the slice153 directories (the adapter check requires them), then build with `--parallel 1`.

Controls (candidate, not owner-measured): CTest 19/19 on the slice156 build, including
`native_quickfix` and `python_native_contracts` (GT4_NATIVE_BUILD on this build). Headless smoke,
4,200 frames, the slice153-156 schedule (12 presses, `--press 600:start:30` then cross/start/down
every 300 frames to 3900, card seed `private/slice113-video/widescreen-seed/card.ps2`):
GT4_FORCE_480P unset gives 42 frame dumps identical to `private/slice155-smoke/headless-155/frames.sha256`.
With `GT4_FORCE_480P=1` the frames are also identical (0 of 42 differ), and `probe.log` has one
line `[display] GT4_FORCE_480P: SetGsCrt interlace 1 mode 0x2 rewritten to interlace 0 mode 0x50`
followed by `[gs] SetGsCrt interlace 0 mode 0x50 field 1`. The headless path does not present to a
window, so these frames say nothing about the displayed image; no correctness claim is made.

Limits:

1. The pinned slice153 adapter still exports `set_widescreen(false)` (4:3 presentation). The
   host never calls it; removing it needs a new adapter pin.
2. `GT4_FORCE_480P` is validated at window start (`validate_environment`) and per SetGsCrt request;
   the headless path does not print the startup line.
3. The 480p rewrite changes only the CRT request. Whether the GS output and the menus follow it is
   the owner's check.
4. Fullscreen uses a WS_POPUP window over the monitor, not exclusive mode; the swapchain follows
   through the existing WM_SIZE path. Owner visual check pending.
5. Alt+Enter is consumed by the host and Enter is not read as Start while Alt is held.
6. Owner gameplay and frame timing are not measured.


Slice157 (TASK-008, all entries) replaces the owner's slice155 table policy with every 8-byte
address of the pinned image (2,048 programs). The owner tested slice155 with 354,837 interpreted
VU1 calls in the rally and 0 in the night race; the all-entries table is the response. Owner
command, from the repository root:

    private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode vu1-all

`--vu1-verify N` and `--vu1-interpret-only` apply as in vu1-full. Pins:
[slice157-vu1-all-runtime.json](inputs/slice157-vu1-all-runtime.json) (capsule, same overlay and
donor hashes as slice155) and [slice157-vu1-all.json](inputs/slice157-vu1-all.json) (launcher,
runtime `private/slice157-vu1-all-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 95,125,504 bytes, sha256 40388a41...2369e).
Directories: table `private/slice157-vu1-all-gen` (vu1_generated.cpp plus 128 parts
`vu1_generated_000.cpp` to `vu1_generated_127.cpp`, 16 programs each), entries
`private/slice157-vu1-all-entries`, corpus `private/slice157-vu1-all-corpus` (2,048 files), capsule
`private/slice157-vu1-all-runtime`, build `private/slice157-vu1-all-build/build`. Image and shaders are
the slice155 and slice153 files, unchanged.

Steps. All outputs are generated offline in fresh private directories and are not committed.

1. Entry lists (policy label recorded in a sidecar, `<list>.json`):
   `scripts\vu1_image.py entries --image private\slice155-vu1-image\vu1_image.bin --policy all --out private\slice157-vu1-all-entries\entries-all.txt`
   (2,048 addresses, sha256 284330f8...). `--policy targeted --table-manifest private\slice154-vu1-flags-gen\manifest.json`
   reproduces the slice155 list (sha256 ec0b9116..., 426 addresses). The targeted policy is kept.
2. Generator (new options, default output unchanged):
   `gt4_vu_recomp --programs-per-file 16 --entry-policy all --image ... --entries private\slice157-vu1-all-entries\entries-all.txt private\slice157-vu1-all-gen`
   writes the table file, the 128 parts and a manifest with `entry_policy`, `programs_per_file` and
   `generated_parts` (file, sha256, bytes, programs). The table file declares every function and holds
   kPrograms; each part defines its 16 functions. CMake compiles every `vu1_generated_*.cpp` in the
   table directory (sorted), so Ninja builds them in parallel.
3. Reproduction control: the same emitter without the new options, on the targeted list, produces
   `vu1_generated.cpp` with sha256 d65474f8..., identical to the slice155 table.
4. Corpus: `scripts\vu1_image.py corpus --image ... --entries private\slice157-vu1-all-entries\entries-all.txt --out private\slice157-vu1-all-corpus`
   writes 2,048 KEY_ENTRY.bin files for the registry control.
5. Runtime capsule: `scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py private\slice157-vu1-all-runtime --vu1-aot`
   (source hashes and overlay 171b07c3... identical to slice155).
6. Configure as slice155 with `GT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE=private/slice157-vu1-all-runtime` and
   `GT4_VU1_GENERATED_DIR=private/slice157-vu1-all-gen`. `GT4_VU_CORPUS_DIR` stays the 426-file
   slice155 corpus (the corpus differential builds its own table from it; see the limits).

Entry policy comparison (Confirmed, from the manifests):
`vu1_image.py compare --targeted <slice155 targeted manifest> --full <slice157 manifest>` reports
426 of 426 targeted rows equal to the full table in key, digest, flag-elision flags, MAC and clip
counts, reachable size, status and function name, 0 differences. The full table has 2,048 emitted,
0 refused, `image_flags_used` true in 2,048 programs, `image_status_used` false in 2,048 programs,
0 interpreter exit sites, `mac_mode` observed in all. Flag elision is per program (the emitter's
`image_flags_used` per record), and the counts show it applied to every program.

Sizes and time (Confirmed, local):

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Table source `vu1_generated.cpp` | 449,433 bytes |
| Part sources `vu1_generated_NNN.cpp` (128) | 51,268,101 bytes (51.7 MB together with the table) |
| Objects, game table (128 parts + table file) | 87.8 MB + 0.8 MB |
| Executable `gt4vulkan.exe` | 95,125,504 bytes (slice155: 62,204,416, +32.9 MB) |
| Emitter `gt4_vu_recomp` (new options) | rebuilt in `private/slice157-vu1-all-tools` |
| Table generation | 2.4 s (emitter) |
| Game table compile | about 3 min wall clock on 16 cores (parts from 06:54 to 06:57) |
| Full configure and build, 231 steps | about 6.5 min, 0 errors, about 2,400 unused-label warnings in the first part of the log |

Results (Confirmed unless marked; candidate, not owner-measured):

- CTest 18/18 on `private/slice157-vu1-all-build/build` (about 2 min). `vu1_aot_registry` against the
  2,048-file corpus: 2,048 of 2,048 table entries found, 10,240 checks, 0 failures. `vu_recomp_core`:
  128 checks (new split-emission control included), 0 failures. `vu_recomp_corpus` (426 programs,
  the slice155 corpus): 0 failures.
- Python: 236 OK, 1 skipped (pre-existing), with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` on the slice157 build. New tests:
  policy comparison (synthetic), a private control for the 2,048 table with 128 parts, and the
  VU1 image tests (19 in total in `test_vu1_image.py`).
- Headless smoke, 4,200 frames, the slice153/154 schedule with 12 presses (`600:start:30`, then
  cross, start, down every 300 frames to `3900:start:30`), no window: 42 frame dumps identical to
  `private/slice154-smoke/final-headless/frames.sha256` (per-file sha256 compared).
- Headless verify, `GT4_VU1_VERIFY=1`, same schedule: completed 4,200 frames, 42 frame dumps identical
  to the smoke run. The probe log has no VU1 counter lines in verify mode; see the journal for the
  counter pass.

Limits:

1. Coverage is now complete over the 2,048 aligned addresses, but the interpreter still runs for any
   entry that is not an 8-byte aligned address in the image, and for any
   program refused by the emitter (0 refused). Owner scenes (rally, night race, showroom) are not run
   here; the owner decides whether `interpreted_calls` is 0 in F8.
2. The corpus differential (`gt4_vu_corpus_differential`) runs over the 426-file slice155 corpus, not
   the 2,048 files. The 2,048 coverage uses the registry control (keys, digests and identity) and the
   static emitter; a standalone 2,048 corpus differential needs one more single-table build (not run).
3. The emitter output for the 2,048 table is about 51.7 MB of C++ in 129 translation units. The
   executable is 32.9 MB larger than slice155 (owner-accepted size).
4. Owner frame measurement is not taken. No speed claim is made. The FlagPipe history limit and the
   `verified` counter limits of slice155 are unchanged.


Slice158 (TASK-009 quick fixes, second candidate) is built on the slice157 all-entries VU1 capsule with the
slice156 quick fixes. Owner command, from the repository root (the slice156 `quickfix` mode and its pins are
kept as history):

    private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode quickfix2

`--force-480p` (GT4_FORCE_480P=1, default off) is accepted by `quickfix2`. The name `quickfix2` is new so that
`quickfix` still reproduces the slice156 binary the owner tested; the two candidates keep separate pins.

Changes:

- 480p through the guest CRT mode table, not SetGsCrt. The table D_00618648 (ELF .data at 0x618648) holds 8
  rows of {id, interlace, mode, field}. `func_001060A0(interlace, mode, field)` returns the id of the first
  matching row (0 when none), and `func_00106058(id)` returns the matching row, or row 8 (the fallback) when
  none matches. When GT4_FORCE_480P=1 the boot hook (donor `system.cpp` `boot()`, after `load_elf`, before the
  main thread starts) checks the pinned bytes and rewrites row id 1 and the fallback row to {0, 0x50, 1}.
  Any other bytes refuse the rewrite with exit status 2. Code: `native/display_table.*`, fixture
  `native/display_table_fixture.cpp` (CTest `native_display_table`), prepare option `--display-table-override`.
- The slice156 `hw.cpp` SetGsCrt rewrite is not part of this capsule (`--gs-crt-override` still derives slice156).
- `late_frames` counts a release only when it is more than 1 ms (frequency / 1000 ticks) after its deadline
  (`native/pacing.*`, fixture `pacing_fixture`). Lateness within the tolerance is not counted.

Pins: [slice158-quickfix2-runtime.json](inputs/slice158-quickfix2-runtime.json) (capsule; `vu_micro.cpp` and
`vif.cpp` byte-identical to slice157, `system.cpp` adds the boot hook) and
[slice158-quickfix2.json](inputs/slice158-quickfix2.json) (launcher; runtime
`private/slice158-quickfix2-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 95,128,576 bytes, sha256 0f498bfc...b6e3b9).
Directories: capsule `private/slice158-quickfix2-runtime`, build `private/slice158-quickfix2-build/build`, table
`private/slice157-vu1-all-gen` (reused), smoke `private/slice158-smoke`.

Steps:

1. `private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py private\slice158-quickfix2-runtime --vu1-aot --display-table-override`
2. Configure as slice157 with `GT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE=private/slice158-quickfix2-runtime` and
   `GT4_VU1_GENERATED_DIR=private/slice157-vu1-all-gen`, `GT4_PORT_DIR` and `GT4_SHADER_DIR` set to the slice153
   directories, then build.

Results (candidate, not owner-measured):

- CTest 20/20 on the slice158 build (includes `native_display_table` and `native_pacing`).
- Python: 251 OK, 1 skipped (pre-existing), with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` on the slice158 build. New tests in
  `tests/python/test_display_table.py`: the pinned ELF rows (skipped when the ELF is absent), the lookup model,
  the boot hook derivation and reversal, and the slice158 pins.
- Headless smoke, 4,200 frames, the slice157 press schedule, no window. `GT4_FORCE_480P` unset: 42 frame dumps
  identical to the slice157 build run with the same script. `GT4_FORCE_480P=1`: the log has
  `[display] GT4_FORCE_480P=1: CRT table rows id 1 and fallback set to interlace 0 mode 0x50 field 1`, the
  frames are identical to the unset run (0 of 42 differ), and the only SetGsCrt line is still
  `[gs] SetGsCrt interlace 1 mode 0x2 field 1`.

Finding, which blocks the 480p claim: the rewritten table does not change the request that reaches the GS.
The boot issues one SetGsCrt (480i) through syscall 0x02 (`kernel.cpp`, stub 0x5ad8a0), called by the GS display
wrappers 0x57fd08 and 0x57fe00, which 0x4a03c0 reaches through a function table (no direct `jal` found). The
table lookups (`func_001060A0` at 0x107640, `func_00106058` at 0x10754C) are a separate path that the headless
boot did not show to change that request. The slice156 SetGsCrt rewrite changed only the syscall argument, and
the owner did not see 480p.

Limits:

1. GT4_FORCE_480P=1 is not a verified 480p switch. Do not test it as 480p until the request path is traced.
2. The fallback row is also rewritten, so unlisted CRT requests resolve to 480p while the switch is on.
3. `--mode quickfix` (slice156) still runs the SetGsCrt rewrite and keeps its owner result.
4. A `--load-state` save restores RAM after the boot hook, so a state saved without the hook keeps its table.
5. Owner gameplay, frame timing and the window (half-height) path are not checked here.

Slice164 (TASK-009, race display index) replaces the slice158 CRT table rewrite, which did not change the
request that reaches the GS. The owner decision: races always 480p; menus keep the original interlaced
behaviour. Owner command, from the repository root (`quickfix`, `quickfix2` and their pins are kept as history):

    private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode quickfix3 --force-480p

Confirmed (from the pinned `private/reconstructed/SCUS_973.28.elf`, text offset = vaddr - 0xFF000; words
decoded by a scratch MIPS reader, checked in `tests/python/test_race_display.py`):

| Guest word | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0x622F4C | owner pointer | `func_001103E0`: `lui v0,0x62; lw a0,0x2F4C(v0)`; `func_0043A490` stores it |
| owner + 0x38CB0 | race option object | `func_001103E0`: `lui at,0x3; ori at,0x8CB0; addu a0,at,a0`, passed to `func_00436740` |
| object + 0x16B0 | race display index (0 normal, 1 480p, 2 1080i) | `func_00436640` 0x43665C `lw v1,0x16B0(s1)`; `func_004363A0` 0x436598 `sw zero,0x16B0(s0)` |
| 0x622DF0 | names table: "normal", "480p", "1080i" | `func_00437380` and `func_004373F0` read it by index |

`func_00436640` (race start) selects the setting by the index: index 1 calls `func_001074D0(&D_006184D0,2,6,640,448)`
(row id 6, the 480p row), index 0 the default row. The index is zero after `setDefault` (0x436598).

Design:

- `native/race_display.*`: pure helpers `race_display_index_address` (owner pointer to index address, 64-bit sum,
  refused outside guest RAM; null owner refused), `should_force_480p_index` (only 0 changes), and
  `force_race_480p_at_vblank` (one guest VBlank: writes 1 at the index when it is 0, counts writes, logs the first).
- Host hook: `native/window.cpp` `on_vblank`, after `pump_messages`, when `GT4_FORCE_480P=1`. No donor source is
  changed: the capsule `private/slice164-quickfix3-runtime` is the slice157 derivation (system.cpp, vu_micro.cpp and
  vif.cpp byte-identical to slice157). The F8 report prints `race display index writes N` when forced.
- Removed: `native/display_override.*` (SetGsCrt rewrite), `native/display_table.*` and
  `display_table_fixture.cpp` (CRT table), the `--gs-crt-override` and `--display-table-override` options of
  `prepare_perf_runtime.py` with their tests, and the CTest `native_display_table`. A build of the slice156 or
  slice158 capsule no longer compiles from this tree; their pins and executables remain as history.
- Fixture: `native/race_display_fixture.cpp` (CTest `native_race_display`): environment parsing, address chain
  (including refused edge owners), write decision, one write then none at 480p, 1080i kept, invalid owner ignored.
- Launcher: `--mode quickfix3` (`docs/inputs/slice164-quickfix3.json`, runtime
  `private/slice164-quickfix3-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`); `--force-480p` is accepted by `quickfix3`.
- Pins: [slice164-quickfix3-runtime.json](inputs/slice164-quickfix3-runtime.json) (capsule receipt and sources).

Steps:

1. `private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py private\slice164-quickfix3-runtime --vu1-aot`
   (done in this slice; the derivation is the slice157 one).
2. Configure as slice157 with `GT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE=private/slice164-quickfix3-runtime`,
   `GT4_VU1_GENERATED_DIR=private/slice157-vu1-all-gen`, `GT4_PORT_DIR` and `GT4_SHADER_DIR` set to the slice153
   directories, then build. The launcher pin is filled after the link (sha256 and size).

Status (candidate, not owner-measured). Built at `private/slice164-quickfix3-build/build` (gt4vulkan.exe 95,126,016 bytes,
sha256 78b92c63...af014e). CTest 20/20 including `native_race_display`. Python discover with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` on this build:
248 run, OK, 1 skipped (pre-existing). Launcher pin `slice164-quickfix3.json` written.

Headless smoke, 4,200 frames, the slice158 12-press schedule, card `private/slice113-video/widescreen-seed/card.ps2`:
- Unset: 42 frame dumps identical to `private/slice158-smoke/headless-158` (0 differ).
- `--force-480p`: 42 dumps identical to the unset run (0 differ) and to the slice158 forced run (0 differ).
- The forced log has no `[display]` line and no `[window]` or `[pacing]` line. The only SetGsCrt is
  `interlace 1 mode 0x2 field 1`, so no race-start request with interlace 0 / mode 0x50 was seen.

**The headless path never calls `open_window`, so the VBlank hook never runs.** The headless smoke therefore
does not test the race display write. Only a windowed run (`probe --window`, which presents) exercises it.
That run has not been done.

Limits:

1. GT4_FORCE_480P does not change the GS, the table or any SetGsCrt request. It writes the game's race option index.
   Whether the race output is 480p on the owner's display is the owner's check; the headless path does not present.
2. The write also happens while the index is 0 outside races (menus, options). A user who chooses "normal" in the
   options menu is moved back to 480p at the next VBlank; the menu may therefore show 480p while the race uses it.
3. The index is forced only when it reads 0; a user choosing 1080i keeps it. The check runs at every VBlank, so a
   reset to 0 by `setDefault` is undone within one frame.
4. The race path (func_00436640) is confirmed from the ELF only by the words above, not by a traced race start.
   The headless schedule may not reach a race; the smoke says so when it does not.
5. No performance claim is made. Owner gameplay is not measured here.
## Build pipeline and tuning (slice159, TASK-010)

Status: local evidence only. No pin, launcher mode or owner session was added (no playable candidate).
Timings were taken under heavy concurrent load from other agents on this machine: compare CPU-seconds
from the ninja log, not wall time, and treat every timing here as not comparable across runs.

Changes (one variable per build directory):

1. Serial recipes removed. The --parallel 1 option is gone from native/build_candidate.cmd,
   tools/ee_producer/build.cmd, tools/ee_producer/build_analysis.cmd and the two EE recipes in
   docs/EE-CANDIDATES.md and docs/EE-CALLBACK-COVERAGE.md. Ninja now uses all cores by default.
2. Corpus table compiled once. tools/vu_recomp/CMakeLists.txt builds the 426-file corpus table as the
   OBJECT library gt4_vu_corpus_table. gt4_vu1_mismatch_replay and gt4_vu_corpus_differential link its
   objects. Before, each compiled its own copy.
3. Flag benchmark on demand. gt4_vu1_flag_bench and its baseline table are EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL. Build them
   explicitly with: cmake --build <build-dir> --target gt4_vu1_flag_bench. No CTest target depends on it.
   Every CTest executable is still built by default (18 tests).
4. Unused-label suppression scoped. -Wno-unused-label is applied only to the generated VU1 sources
   (native/CMakeLists.txt, set_source_files_properties). Measured on one part (vu1_generated_000.cpp,
   slice157 capsule, /O2 /Ob2): 2,484 unused-label warnings without the suppression, 0 with it. Other
   parts were not measured; the earlier "about 65,000" figure was not verified.
5. Tuning options (CMakeLists.txt, default OFF, applied to every target of the tree):
   - -DGT4_FP_CONTRACT_OFF=ON adds /clang:-ffp-contract=off (control, T0).
   - -DGT4_X86_64_V3=ON adds /clang:-march=x86-64-v3 and implies the fp-contract flag (T1).
   The pinned EE game library ps2game.lib is not rebuilt, so its code keeps the default flags.
6. Compiler cache (S4, not installed). sccache or ccache needs owner approval. The hook would be
   -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache on the configure line. Not done.

Build commands (fresh directories; the worktree private directory is a junction to the main checkout so
the perf capsule and port paths pass the checks in native/CMakeLists.txt):

    cmake -S <worktree> -B <main>/private/slice159-build-<name>/build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-cl.exe" -DGT4_ASSETS_ROOT=<main>
      -DGT4_EE_PROFILE=production -DGT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE=<worktree>/private/slice157-vu1-all-runtime
      -DGT4_PORT_DIR=<worktree>/private/slice153-pacing-port -DGT4_SHADER_DIR=<worktree>/private/slice153-pacing-shaders
      -DGT4_VU1_GENERATED_DIR=<main>/private/slice157-vu1-all-gen -DGT4_VU_CORPUS_DIR=<main>/private/slice155-vu1-full-corpus
      -DGT4_PYTHON=<main>/private/tooling-venv/Scripts/python.exe [-DGT4_FP_CONTRACT_OFF=ON | -DGT4_X86_64_V3=ON]
    cmake --build <main>/private/slice159-build-<name>/build

Measurements (CPU-seconds are the sum of job durations in .ninja_log; wall time is not comparable):

| Build | Jobs | Wall (load-affected) | CPU-s |
|---|---|---|---|
| slice157 (baseline, slice158 plan) | 240 | 401 s | 3,942 |
| slice159 S1-S3 (slice159-build-s123) | 230 | 189 s | 1,700 |
| slice159 T0 -ffp-contract=off | 230 | 231 s | 2,045 |
| slice159 T1 x86-64-v3 + T0 | 230 | 229 s | 2,216 |

The S1-S3 build removes the 204 s serial flag-bench tail and two of three corpus-table compiles (about
176 CPU-s). The T0 and T1 CPU-s are higher under the same load, which the flags alone do not explain: the
runs overlapped with other agents' compiles. Treat the CPU-s column as an upper bound until repeated on an
idle machine.

Correctness (Confirmed):

- T0 vs slice157: the runtime library differs as a file, but the disassembly of 159 of 160 runtime objects
  is identical. The exception is vu_micro.cpp (slice157 runtime capsule): instruction order and register
  choice differ, with no FMA emitted for the default target.
- Headless 4,200 frames, the slice153/154 schedule (12 presses), frame dumps every 100 frames: T0 42 of 42
  identical to private/slice157-smoke/headless-157/frames; T1 (v3) 42 of 42 identical.
- CTest 18/18 on S1-S3 (slice159-build-s123), T0 and T1 (slice159-build-v3).
- Python unittest discover: 236 OK, 1 skipped (pre-existing), with GT4_NATIVE_BUILD on the S1-S3 and T0 builds.

VU1 micro-benchmark, baseline vs v3 (gt4_vu1_flag_bench 50 2 private/slice155-vu1-full-corpus):

| Build | Elided ns/call (timed calls, best of 2 passes) | Compared / failures |
|---|---|---|
| default (slice159-build-s123) | 10,715 | 852 / 0 |
| x86-64-v3 (slice159-build-v3) | 11,630 | 852 / 0 |

Verdict: Unknown. The run shared the machine with other compiles. The v3 build is not faster in this run.
Rerun on an idle machine, 3 or more times each, and compare the elided figure:

    <main>/private/slice159-build-s123/build/gt4_vu1_flag_bench.exe 200 5 <main>/private/slice155-vu1-full-corpus
    <main>/private/slice159-build-v3/build/gt4_vu1_flag_bench.exe 200 5 <main>/private/slice155-vu1-full-corpus

Limits:

1. The T0 and T1 flags apply to the runtime, the generated VU1 code and the tests. The pinned EE library
   and the qualified donor objects are not rebuilt by these options.
2. Frame identity is shown for one 4,200-frame headless schedule, not for owner gameplay. No speed claim.
3. PGO, ThinLTO, the dispatch divide change and the sccache option are not implemented or measured.
4. No candidate pin or launcher mode was added: T0 and T1 are build variants only, not playable candidates.

## Slice 160 (TASK-013): VU0 microcode AOT

The 14 `VCALLMS` entries of the pinned VU0 image (docs/VU0-MICROCODE-MAP.md) run compiled. The
VU0 emitter profile is `gt4_vu_recomp --unit 0`; the VU1 profile is unchanged (its table
`vu1_generated.cpp` and manifest hashes equal slice157: 3eed39d6... and 07ae2077...). Pins:
[slice160-vu0-image.json](inputs/slice160-vu0-image.json) (static image),
[slice160-vu0-runtime.json](inputs/slice160-vu0-runtime.json) (runtime capsule, VU1 and VU0 overlays)
and [slice160-vu0-aot.json](inputs/slice160-vu0-aot.json) (launcher).

Steps, from the repository root. Outputs go to fresh private directories:

1. `vu0_image.py build --elf private\reconstructed\SCUS_973.28.elf --out private\slice160-vu0-image`
   reads the 2,688-byte upload at file offset 0x5D4280 (vaddr 0x6D3280) and pads it with zeros to
   4096 bytes. Upload sha256 6ee4bdde...; image sha256 2d7b2653.... `vu0_image.py entries` writes the
   14 addresses (sha256 2f5ac510...). The list includes 0x308 and 0x478, which the slice-158 plan
   counted as fall-through suffixes; both are kept so every listed VCALLMS target runs compiled.
2. Emitter: `gt4_vu_recomp --unit 0 --namespace gt4::vugen::vu0 --entry-policy vcallms --image
   private\slice160-vu0-image\vu0_image.bin --entries private\slice160-vu0-image\entries-vcallms.txt
   private\slice160-vu0-gen-r3`. Output `vu0_generated.cpp` (14 programs, 0 refused) and manifest.json
   (`"unit": 0`, `identity_tag` GT4-VU0-PROGRAM-IDENTITY-1).
3. Runtime capsule: `prepare_perf_runtime.py private\slice160-vu0-runtime --vu0-aot` (implies
   `--vu1-aot`). The VU1 overlay hash stays 171b07c3...; VU0 overlay 9e5fee2b....
4. Build: configure with `GT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE` = the capsule, `GT4_VU1_GENERATED_DIR`
   = `private\slice157-vu1-all-gen` and `GT4_VU0_GENERATED_DIR` = the VU0 directory. Build directory
   `private\slice160-vu0-build\build`. The executable has `GT4_VU0_AOT` defined; the VU0 counters
   are in the F8 report.
5. Controls (CTest 21/21): `vu0_emitter` (20 checks), `vu0_aot_registry` (14 of 14 entries; 87 checks),
   `vu0_aot_differential` (below), plus the existing VU1 suites.

Owner command (from the repository root): `python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root . --mode vu0-aot`.
Verify: add `--vu0-verify 50` (samples every 50th VU0 call against the exact interpreter path).
`--vu1-verify` and `--vu1-interpret-only` also apply in this mode.

Numbers (local controls only; no owner session):

- Differential, `gt4_vu0_differential_tests`: 14 entries, 1000 finite and 1000 raw-bit seeds each
  (28,000 comparisons over every Vu0Regs field and the 4 KiB data memory), 896 budget-resume runs with
  budgets 1 to 24, 0 failures. Negative control: `interpret(0, pc)` (run_fast) differs from `run(0, pc)`
  in MAC or status in 768 states, which is why hand-offs use the exact path.
- Registry, `gt4_vu0_aot_registry_test`: 14 of 14 entries found, changed reachable word not registered,
  padding change keeps the hit, `code_changed(0)` invalidates, VF0 not normalized takes the interpreter.
- Headless smoke, 4200 frames, the slice157 schedule (12 presses), no window: 42 frame dumps identical
  to `private/slice157-smoke/headless-157/frames`. `[perf] vu0_aot compiled_calls=1256000
  interpreted_calls=0 budget_resumes=0 handoffs=0 identity_rejects=0`.
- Headless verify, `GT4_VU0_VERIFY=1`, same schedule: 42 frame dumps identical; `verified=1255999
  verify_mismatches=0`.
- Python: unittest discover with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` on this build: 246 OK, 1 skipped (pre-existing).
- Executable `gt4vulkan.exe` 95,529,984 bytes, sha256 a0206c16... (after the merge of task/010-build-pipeline).

Limits:

1. The VCALLMS list is the 14 entries of the VU0 map. The EE call-site scan was not run (the donor has
   no VCALLMS decoder), so an EE call to another address is counted as `interpreted_calls`.
2. Only the headless schedule was run. Owner scenes are not verified.
3. Hand-offs inside generated code (a JR to a return site outside the table's static set, or a budget
   resume) run `run(0, pc)` and are counted as `handoffs`, not `interpreted_calls`.
4. VU0 uses the donor exact `fp::` arithmetic (the `run(0)` path). VU1 keeps its `run_fast` SIMD path.
   The VU1 SIMD `vitof`/`vftoi` helpers are not bit-identical to the donor per-lane conversion. VU1
   output is unchanged (byte-identical control), so this is an open finding for VU1, not investigated.
5. `private/` in the worktree is a directory junction to the main checkout (see the report).

## Slice 168 - audio test silenced (TASK-015 part B)

`native/host_io_fixture.cpp` now submits zeroed PCM in both the ramp and the paced sawtooth buffers. The assertions
are unchanged. Build only the fixture, then run its CTest:

```
cmake -S . -B private\slice168-audio-build\build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-cl.exe" -DGT4_EE_PROFILE=production ^
  -DGT4_ASSETS_ROOT=C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp
cmake --build private\slice168-audio-build\build --target host_io_fixture
ctest --test-dir private\slice168-audio-build\build -R native_audio_input --output-on-failure
```

## Slice 169 - MTVU measurement (TASK-011 step 0)

Counters for the VU1 worker plan ([MTVU-PLAN](MTVU-PLAN.md) section 9). No guest-visible change.
Built from the `task/011-mtvu` worktree with every private input in the main checkout (no junction):
`native/CMakeLists.txt` and `tools/vu_recomp/CMakeLists.txt` now qualify capsules, port, shaders, donor and
VU0 image against `GT4_ASSETS_ROOT` (equal to the source root in the main checkout, so main builds are unchanged).

```
python scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice169-mtvu-measure-runtime ^
  --assets-root C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp --mtvu-measure
cmake -S <worktree> -B C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice169-mtvu-measure-build/build -G Ninja ^

cmake --build C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice169-mtvu-measure-build/build
```

The capsule adds `gif.cpp` (donor `gs/gif.cpp`, sha256 eee761d7...) and `memory.cpp` (c33b9fed...). Without
`--mtvu-measure` the derivation reproduces the slice160 capsule byte for byte (Python control). Receipt
sha256 afeeea67...; executable `gt4vulkan.exe` 95,539,712 bytes, sha256
72fe2ad32ce76477d181e6bf8883644c84fc16c696563fce0a261eafebfc39e2. The compiler on PATH reported
clang-cl 22.1.3 at configure time (slice166 records 23.1.2; same executable path).

Launcher: `--mode mtvu-measure` (pin `docs/inputs/slice169-mtvu-measure.json`), same options as `main`.
`GT4_MTVU_MEASURE` (0 or 1, default on) and `GT4_MTVU_MEASURE_EVERY` are validated before any output,
forwarded and recorded in `result.json`. A worktree without `private/` takes the pinned binaries from
`--assets-root` (`binary_workspace_for`); `external_runtime_probe.py` gained `--assets-root` for headless runs.

Controls:

- CTest 24/24, including the new `native_mtvu_measure` (GIF scanner with split packets, REGLIST/IMAGE
  skipping and NREG 0; overlap model with authored timestamps; interval arithmetic; report lines; switch values).
- Python unittest discover (GT4_NATIVE_BUILD = this build, GT4_ASSETS_ROOT = main checkout): 264 OK, 12 skipped
  (tests that need `private/` in the source checkout).
- Headless 4,200 frames, slice157 schedule (`external_runtime_probe.py --assets-root <main> --runtime-manifest
  docs/inputs/slice169-mtvu-measure.json --card-seed <main>/private/slice113-video/widescreen-seed/card.ps2`
  plus the 12 presses): 42 dumps identical to a fresh slice166 run and to
  `private/slice157-smoke/headless-157/frames`, with the counters on and with `GT4_MTVU_MEASURE=0`.
  Outputs: `private/slice169-smoke/headless-{on,off,166}`.

Owner command (from the worktree or, after merge, the main checkout):
`python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode mtvu-measure --force-480p`

Limits: downloads are counted as TRXDIR=1 writes, not `gs::read_image` calls; EE counts cover the slow
memory path, which is the only EE path to VU memory in the donor; host timings are only meaningful on an
idle machine.

## Slice170 - MTVU step 2 (TASK-011): VU1 on a worker thread

Branch `task/011-mtvu`, worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-011` (no `private/` junction). Capsule
`private/slice170-mtvu-runtime`, derived from the main checkout:

```
python scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice170-mtvu-runtime ^
  --assets-root C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp --mtvu
```

`--mtvu` implies `--vu0-aot`; its hooks are `prepare_perf_runtime.py` `MTVU_PATCHES`. Without `--mtvu` the
derivation reproduces slice160 (`system.cpp`, `vif.cpp`, `vu_micro.cpp`, `runtime.json`) and slice169 byte for byte.
Pin: `docs/inputs/slice170-mtvu-runtime.json` (receipt sha256 4e5f1e4dc2c1287dd73572e083794475dbfd2f6726badfbdffb8303ce4645e20).

Build (clang-cl 22.1.3, Ninja, Release; same pinned inputs as slice169, new runtime capsule):

```
cmake -S C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-011 -B C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice170-mtvu-build\build -G Ninja ^

cmake --build C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice170-mtvu-build\build
```

Executable `gt4vulkan.exe` 95,561,728 bytes, sha256 a0b4968b2c59071bb06945b263e195a939ad2bb2c53513590a05244536cd333e.
Launcher pin: `docs/inputs/slice170-mtvu.json` (mode `mtvu`). Step 1 fixtures (`native_mtvu_ring`,
`native_mtvu_journal`) are in the same build.

Controls:

- CTest 26/26 on `private/slice170-mtvu-build/build` (includes `native_mtvu_ring`, `native_mtvu_journal`).
- Headless 4,200 frames, slice157 press schedule (12 presses), frame dumps every 100 frames, compared with
  `private/slice157-smoke/headless-157/frames`: 42 of 42 identical for `GT4_MTVU=1` (three runs: `on`, `on2`,
  `on3`), and 42 of 42 identical for `GT4_MTVU=0` (`off`). Outputs `private/slice170-smoke/{on,on2,on3,off}`.
- `GT4_MTVU_VERIFY=1` headless, on and off (`verify-on`, `verify-off`): 4,200 `[mtvu-verify]` lines each, 0 VIF1
  shadow/worker mismatches, and the per-frame GS render hash identical in all 4,200 frames (4,196 frames carry GS
  renders). Frame dumps of both runs identical to the reference (42 of 42).
- Python: 264 OK, 12 skipped (`GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` on this build, `GT4_ASSETS_ROOT` main checkout).

Owner A/B (showroom, night race, rally; one F7/F8 interval each; the `mtvu` mode is the same for both):

```
set GT4_MTVU=0
python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode mtvu --force-480p
set GT4_MTVU=1
python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode mtvu --force-480p
```

`GT4_MTVU` unset means 1. Add `GT4_MTVU_VERIFY=1` for a stream check (the per-frame `[mtvu-verify]` lines; MTVU
on and off must print the same `gs` hashes). Known limit: F8 is not per-thread yet (MTVU-PLAN section 11.5), so
the owner's F8 under MTVU is flagged invalid by the probe until step 3.

### Slice171 - MTVU step 3 (per-thread F8)

Same runtime capsule as slice170 (`private/slice170-mtvu-runtime`, unchanged). Build `private/slice171-mtvu-build`
(same CMake recipe as slice170, with `-DGT4_PERF_RUNTIME_SOURCE=.../slice170-mtvu-runtime`). `gt4vulkan.exe`
95,569,920 bytes, sha256 6e60fe72bc870c25d6252cb79b276fbbd870b857dc10343855854cb0ee37269d. Launcher pin
`docs/inputs/slice171-mtvu.json`; mode `mtvu` now points to it.

Owner A/B (PowerShell, from the worktree or the main checkout; `GT4_MTVU` unset means 1):

```
$env:GT4_MTVU="0"; C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode mtvu --force-480p
$env:GT4_MTVU="1"; C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode mtvu --force-480p
```

Compare, per scene (showroom, night race, rally, Nordschleife TT 480p), the F8 lines `frame ms` (median, p95,
p99, max), `VBlanks/s`, the `exclusive wall ms/frame` line (`vu1_aot`, `vu1_interpret`, `ee_dispatch`, `gs_execute`),
and with GT4_MTVU=1 the `[mtvu]` lines: `EE wait ms/frame` (by reason; `mtvu_wait_vblank` should be small),
`EE gs_drain`, `worker ms/frame` (vu1_program, output_path12, busy, idle), and `overlap achieved`.
Acceptance (MTVU-PLAN step 5): median and p99 equal or better in each scene; `vu1_aot` on the EE thread near 0 with
MTVU on (the worker's time appears in the `[mtvu]` worker line). F8 under MTVU is valid (no INVALID line).
Headless identity check: `GT4_MTVU_REPORT_EVERY=500 external_runtime_probe.py ... --runtime-manifest docs\inputs\slice171-mtvu.json`
(42 frames compared with slice157).

### Slice172 - MTVU step 4 (EE-side signals) and step 6 (`--cpu-cores`) (TASK-011)

Runtime capsule `private/slice172-mtvu-runtime`, derived from the main checkout (the same derivation as slice170 with the
step 4 `gif.cpp` hook; `runtime.json` profile `step4-runtime-v2`):

```
python scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice172-mtvu-runtime --assets-root C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp --mtvu
```

Pin: `docs/inputs/slice172-mtvu-runtime.json` (receipt sha256 ca565bbcd75214074fc333aed3cafda6b580e1b078ea221ad4519b8028fc0d29).

Launcher pin `docs/inputs/slice172-mtvu.json`; launcher mode `mtvu` now uses it (`mtvu-slice171` keeps slice171).
Tests: `ctest --test-dir C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice172-mtvu-build\build --output-on-failure` (27 tests);
Python: `$env:GT4_NATIVE_BUILD="C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice172-mtvu-build\build"` then
`private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests/python`.

Weak-CPU simulation: `play_performance.py --cpu-cores N` (1 to the logical CPU count) limits the game process with
`SetProcessAffinityMask` after start; distinct physical cores first. Refused outside performance runs. Recorded as
`cpu_affinity` in `result.json`. See MTVU-PLAN section 12.5 and 12.6 for the owner A/B.

### Slice178 - release 1.0.0 W1: MTVU in `--mode main` (TASK-011)

`--mode main` is the slice172 MTVU runtime with the slice166 main features, pinned as `docs/inputs/slice178-main.json`. The
runtime capsule is `private/slice178-main-runtime`, derived from the main checkout with the same flags as slice172 (receipt
ca565bbc... identical, pin `docs/inputs/slice178-main-runtime.json`):

```
python scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice178-main-runtime ^
  --assets-root C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp --mtvu
```

Configure and build from the worktree source (fresh build directory in the main checkout's `private/`; no junctions; shader and
port paths are main-checkout absolute):

```

cmake --build C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice178-main-build\build
```

Result: `gt4vulkan.exe` 95,570,944 bytes, sha256 6d71f531e4dc84338cb4163b1aba643b077933f68005cb101391e811e7db1094. CMake
accepts the capsule name in `native/CMakeLists.txt` (slice178 added to each allowlist).

Checks: `ctest --test-dir C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice178-main-build\build` 27/27. Python: with
`GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` on that build and `GT4_ASSETS_ROOT` the main checkout, `unittest discover -s tests/python` 281 OK, 12 skipped.
Headless: `external_runtime_probe.py` with `--runtime-manifest docs/inputs/slice178-main.json`, 4,200 frames, the 12 slice157
presses; 42/42 frames identical to `private/slice157-smoke/headless-157/frames` for `GT4_MTVU=1` (three runs) and `GT4_MTVU=0`
(one run), and for the default environment (one run).

Owner commands (PowerShell):

```
python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode main
$env:GT4_MTVU="0"; python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode main
```

`--mode main` holds the race display at 480p (the launcher sets `force_480p`); the hidden opt-out is `GT4_FORCE_480P=0`, which the
probe records. `--mode mtvu` keeps the slice172 pin and binary. Owner A/B and weak-CPU runs are pending (MTVU-PLAN section 12.6).

## Slice191 - GS stream protocol and the `GT4_RENDERER=pcsx2` seam (TASK-035)

Branch `task/035-gs-stream`, worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-035-stream` (no `private/` junction; derived capsules and
the build live in the main checkout's `private/`). Spec: [GS-STREAM-PROTOCOL](GS-STREAM-PROTOCOL.md).

Derivations (fresh directories; `<A>` = `C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp`):

```
python scripts\prepare_external_vulkan.py <A>/private/slice191-gs-stream-port --assets-root <A> --gs-stream-hooks
python scripts\prepare_perf_runtime.py <A>/private/slice191-gs-stream-runtime --assets-root <A> --gs-stream
```

Controls: without `--gs-stream-hooks` the port derivation reproduces `slice153-pacing-port` byte for byte; without
`--gs-stream` the runtime derivation reproduces `slice178-main-runtime` (checked in `tests/python/test_gs_stream.py`).
The slice191 runtime changes only `gif.cpp` and `hw.cpp`; the port changes only `gs.cpp`. Pin:
`docs/inputs/slice191-gs-stream-runtime.json` (receipt sha256 d41d2d689a384efb5b5df116eba9750d43bd67870fb7d162067695ec8eab2326,
profile `task035-seam-v1`, port `gs.cpp` 12a989e6...). CMake accepts the slice191 port only with the slice191 runtime and
links `gt4_gs_stream_client` into the runtime for that pair.

Configure and build (clang-cl, Ninja, Release; same EE library, VU1/VU0 tables and slice153 shaders as slice178):

```

`docs/inputs/slice191-pcsx2-stream.json` (mode `pcsx2-stream`; the manifest's `gs_stream` block pins the recorder as the
GS process). Not for owner play: in `pcsx2` mode the window stays black (the consumer is not a renderer).

Checks (2026-10-15, idle machine):

- CTest 29/29 (new: `native_gs_stream_ipc`, `native_gs_stream_client`; `native_mtvu_perf` now checks that the four
  `gs_ipc_*` categories follow the MTVU ones). Python (`GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` on this build, `GT4_ASSETS_ROOT` the main
  checkout): 321 tests OK, 12 skipped.
- Headless, 4,200 frames, slice157 schedule (12 presses), `external_runtime_probe.py --runtime-manifest
  docs/inputs/slice191-pcsx2-stream.json`, outputs `private/slice191-smoke/final-*`:
  - `GT4_RENDERER` unset: 42/42 frames identical to `private/slice157-smoke/headless-157/frames`.
  - `GT4_RENDERER=donor GT4_GS_CAPTURE=...`: 42/42 identical; capture 2,599,116,800 bytes, sha256 e651bba3....
  - `GT4_RENDERER=pcsx2` with the recorder (`GT4_GS_RECORD_OUTPUT`) and `GT4_GS_CAPTURE`: run completes (frame limit
    reached, no frame dumps in this mode); the in-process capture is byte-identical to the donor capture (e651bba3...),
    and the recorder's file is the same bytes plus the 48-byte CONTROL shutdown record (sha256 73bee2da...).
  - Stream: 1,637,885 records, 2.60 GB, 619 KB and 390 records per frame on average (1,612,695 GIF records, 20,986
    PRIV, 0 READ_FIFO, 3 RESET). Readbacks: 0 in this schedule (menus).
- Converter and PoC replay: `gscap_to_gsdump.py <recorded> stream-0-1100.gs --max-frames 1101` gives a dump
  byte-identical to the TASK-034 PoC dump `private/slice190-dump/menu-0-1100.gs`; the PoC `pcsx2-gsrunner.exe`
  (`private/slice190-run`, 1x, `-surfaceless -renderer vulkan -loop 1 -perf -dumpdir`) produced 1,100 PNGs, all
  byte-identical to `private/slice190-gsrunner-out/1x/f` (frames 300 and 700 included). Outputs: `private/slice191-gsrunner`.

Headless commands (PowerShell, from the worktree; add the stream variables per case):

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` cannot be created, for example in a sandbox).

Checks: CTest 29/29 (the stream client fixture checks the SYNCV values and the SMODE1, SYNCV, SMODE2 order); Python
410 OK, 6 skipped; donor 42/42 identical to slice195; pcsx2 1x live 41 frames: 40 differ from slice195 (the 480i
frames are now deinterlaced), and frames 100-1400 are pixel-identical to the offline 0.3.2 replay of the SYNCV
stream with the live settings (slice195 live = offline 0.3.1 replay of the old stream, same method).

## Slice198 - PCSX2 GS path performance (TASK-041)

Branch `task/041-gs-perf` (from main `a1a06a4`). Same capsules, shaders, VU tables and gt4-gs package (`gt4gs-v0.3.2`,

  `private/slice198-gs-perf-build/build`, assets root the main checkout); `guard.ps1` waits until no ninja, cl,
  clang-cl or link process runs (another task builds in parallel);
- pin: `make_manifest.py <worktree> <assets root>` writes `docs/inputs/slice198-pcsx2.json` from slice196 with the
  new runtime pin;
- headless: `headless-198.sh <run> [env]` (slice157 menus schedule), `headless-race.sh` / `race-run.sh <run> [env]`
  (race schedule, 16,000 frames, keeps `probe-nosys.log`: the syscall trace makes the full log about 1 GB),
  `analyze.py <first report> <runs>` (averages of the F8-equivalent reports), timing sets `timing-set1.sh`
  (slice196 vs slice198, privileged sync on/off, wake batching off), `timing-set2.sh` (cold/warm cache, GS spin),
  `timing-set3.sh` (donor vs pcsx2 menus); outputs in `private/slice198-smoke`, race route exploration
  `explore.sh`.

Pins `docs/inputs/slice198-pcsx2.json` (`gt4vulkan.exe` 95,667,712 bytes, sha256 `8658cffa...`); `--mode pcsx2` points
here, `--mode pcsx2-slice196` keeps slice196. The worktree holds file copies (no links) of every pinned file of both
modes plus the gt4-gs package, cache and data folders (`private/slice198-gs-perf-build`, `slice196-gs-deinterlace-build`,
`slice153-pacing-shaders`, `slice196-gt4gs-release-pkg`, `slice193-gt4gs-cache`, `slice193-gt4gs-data`; hashes and the
package tree digest checked), so `--mode pcsx2` runs from the worktree.

Switches: `GT4_MTVU_PRIV_ASYNC` (default 1; 0 = slice196 privileged sync), `GT4_GS_WAKE_BYTES` (default 262144; 0 =
wake on every record), `GT4_GS_STREAM_HASH=1` (test aid: F8 and session stream hash).

Checks: CTest 29/29; Python 416 OK, 16 skipped; donor 42/42 identical to slice157 (two runs); pcsx2 1x 41/41 identical
to slice196 (two runs); menus `.gscap` donor/pcsx2 slice198 = pcsx2 slice196 (`4ff3993d...`); race stream hash with the
privileged sync on and off identical (`9b88c23e984ff940`, 588 queued writes), race frames 159/159 identical.
Details and timings: [GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md) section 9.

## Slice197 - JIT-free gt4-gs (TASK-042)

Branch `task/042-gs-nojit` (worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-042-nojit`, from main `a1a06a4`), fork branch `gt4gs/nojit`
(worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4recomp-gs-nojit`, commit `4c8b63a6e`, tag `gt4gs-v0.4.0`). No game change: the pin
`docs/inputs/slice197-pcsx2.json` keeps the slice196 runtime (`private/slice196-gs-deinterlace-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`,
sha256 `f09489df...`) and pins the published gt4-gs 0.4.0 package.

- gt4-gs iteration build: fork recipe plus `-DGT4GS_ONLY=ON` into `private/slice197-gt4gs-build` (712 steps cold; removed
  after the release), packaged by hand into `private/slice197-gt4gs-devpkg` (0.3.2 DLLs and resources, new exe).
- Release: `gt4gs/release-local.ps1 -Tag gt4gs-v0.4.0 -Build private\slice197-gt4gs-release-build -Deps
  private\slice193-gt4gs-deps\root\deps -OutDir private\slice197-gt4gs-release -NoPublish` (log
  `private/slice197-release-0.4.0.log`), then `gh release create` with the same assets and notes; downloaded back to
  `private/slice197-gt4gs-download` (SHA256SUMS OK, identical to the local zip) and extracted with Expand-Archive to
  `private/slice197-gt4gs-release-pkg` (140 files, tree sha256 `e9402cf2...`, `gt4-gs.exe` sha256 `1c4c45da...`).
- Static check: `powershell -File tools\gs_nojit_check\check-nojit.ps1 -Path private\slice197-gt4gs-release-pkg
  [-Report <json>]` (needs Visual Studio's `dumpbin`, found with vswhere); exit 0 = pass.
- Streams for the offline checks (re-captured, the TASK-035/047 files were gone): `GT4_GS_CAPTURE` on a headless slice157
  schedule, slice195 runtime (no SYNCV, sha256 `e651bba3...` = the slice191 capture) and slice196 runtime (SYNCV, sha256
  `4ff3993d...`); deleted after the checks (2.6 GB each; recapture in about a minute).
- Offline replay: `gt4-gs.exe -perf --config <ini> --replay-gscap <stream>` with `[GT4GS] DataRoot`, `DumpDir`,
  `DumpEvery` and `[Folders] Cache = private/slice197-gt4gs-cache`; frame comparison by bytes, then pixels. Reports
  `private/slice197-runs/*.json`, console logs `private/slice197-runs/*/console.log`.
- The worktree holds copies (files, not links) of the pinned `private/` files: the slice196 `gt4vulkan.exe`, the nine
  `slice153-pacing-shaders` files, `slice197-gt4gs-release-pkg`, `slice196-gt4gs-release-pkg`, `slice193-gt4gs-cache`
  and `slice193-gt4gs-data`, checked by hash and tree digest.

Checks: CTest 29/29 (slice196 build); Python 414 OK, 15 skipped (`GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = the slice196 build; new
`tests/python/test_gs_nojit.py`); static check pass (0.3.2 fails it with 22 markers); offline 1x/3x frames byte-identical to
0.3.2 on both menu streams; headless game from the worktree: donor 42/42 identical to slice157, pcsx2 1x 41/41 identical to
slice196 live, GS process exit 0, ACG on and 0 executable non-image regions in the log. Details: [GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md)
section 10.


## Slice199 - TASK-041 on the JIT-free gt4-gs 0.4.0

Branch `task/041-gs-perf` (worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-041-perf`), merged with main `ecda378` (TASK-042 merged,
PR #33). No game change: the game build is slice198 (`private/slice198-gs-perf-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 95,667,712
bytes, sha256 `8658cffa...`, the same file as slice198), so no new executable and no CMake run. The GS package is the
published `gt4gs-v0.4.0` of slice197 (`private/slice197-gt4gs-release-pkg`, 140 files, tree `e9402cf2...`, zip sha256
`5c92ad00...`, `gt4-gs.exe` 8,928,256 bytes, sha256 `1c4c45da...`).

Pins: `docs/inputs/slice199-pcsx2.json` (new; slice198 and slice197 pins are not edited). `--mode pcsx2` = slice199;
`--mode pcsx2-slice198` (gt4-gs 0.3.2) and `--mode pcsx2-slice197` (game build of slice196, gt4-gs 0.4.0) stay for A/B.
The worktree holds file copies (no links) of every pinned input of slice199, copied from the main checkout and checked by
size and sha256 (18 files plus the 140-file package tree digest).

Checks (2026-10-16): CTest 29/29 on `private/slice198-gs-perf-build/build`; Python `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = that build:
438 tests OK, 20 skipped (missing data only); no-JIT static check `tools/gs_nojit_check` on the slice199 package: 23
modules, no code generator markers, no writable+executable sections; headless (slice157 menus schedule, 4,200 frames):
donor 42/42 identical to slice157; pcsx2 1x 41/41 identical to slice198 (gt4-gs 0.3.2); gt4-gs 0.4.0 log: Arbitrary Code Guard on, 0 executable non-image regions.

Headless (PowerShell, from the worktree; outputs in the main checkout's `private/slice199-smoke`, the probe refuses
outputs outside `private/`):

```
python scripts\external_runtime_probe.py C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice199-smoke/<run> --frames 4200 --timeout 2400 `
  --press 600:start:30 ... --card-seed C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice113-video/widescreen-seed/card.ps2 `
  --runtime-manifest docs/inputs/slice199-pcsx2.json --assets-root C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp
```

Add `GT4_RENDERER=pcsx2 GT4_GS_SCALE=1 GT4_GS_ASPECT=auto` for the pcsx2 runs (`GT4_MTVU_REPORT_EVERY=500` for the F8 lines).
Details: [GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md) section 10.5.

## Slice200 - release 1.0.0 hardening (TASK-058 crash-safe card, TASK-059 installed folder)

Branch `task/058-059-release-hardening` (worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-058-harden`, from main `3b5334d`). The game
build changes: the executable, a new port (`private/slice200-port`, `main.cpp` only) and a new memory card capsule
(`private/slice200-memcard-runtime`). The GS package stays gt4-gs 0.4.0 (`private/slice197-gt4gs-release-pkg`).

- TASK-058, memory card: the atomic writer of TASK-025 Part A (`native/memcard_store.*`, `memcard_store_fixture.cpp`,
  `scripts/prepare_memcard_flush.py`, `tests/python/test_memcard_flush.py`) was on `task/025-save-manager` (commit
  `c9e90bd`), not on main; it is imported here with its CMake and `window.cpp` hunks. The memcard capsule is derived by
  `scripts/prepare_memcard_flush.py --assets-root <main checkout>` into `private/slice200-memcard-runtime` (`sio2.cpp`,
  `runtime.json` with its SHA-256 `8e3bf667...`). CMake option `GT4_MEMCARD_RUNTIME_SOURCE` replaces the donor
  `iop/sio2.cpp`, links `gt4_memcard` and defines `GT4_MEMCARD_FLUSH_OVERLAY` for `gt4vulkan` (window.cpp calls
  `flush_cards_now()` after `emulate()` returns, which covers the halt after the GS-process grace VSYNCs as well).
  A failed write keeps the card dirty and retries after 50 VBlanks.
- TASK-059, installed folder: `native/install_paths.*` (shaders in `<exe folder>\shaders`, else the build-time folder;
  GS process `GT4_GS_PROCESS`, else `<exe folder>\gs\gt4-gs.exe`), used by `native_vulkan.cpp` and `gs_stream_client.cpp`;
  `--portable-check` and the headless exit flush (`flush_cards_now()` after `emulate()`) in the port `main.cpp`. The TASK-019 branch version of the shader change had a broken `printf`
  string (a literal line break) and was rewritten here.
- Pins: `docs/inputs/slice200-pcsx2.json` (new; `--mode pcsx2` = slice200; `--mode pcsx2-slice199` keeps the slice199
  runtime) and `docs/inputs/slice200-gs-stream-runtime.json` (new port manifest: the slice191 manifest with the new
  `main.cpp` hash). slice199 and slice191 pins are not edited.
- `--mode main` (slice178) is not rebuilt: its build is not shared with slice200, so it keeps the old card flush and no
  `--portable-check`. A slice200 main build would need its own pin.

Build (fresh directories in the main checkout; `cmd /c` with the VS x64 environment, same cache as slice198 except the
new capsules):

```
cmake -S C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-058-harden -B C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice200-build\build -G Ninja ^
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-cl.exe" -DGT4_EE_PROFILE=production ^

cmake --build C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice200-build\build
```

Result: `gt4vulkan.exe` 95,680,000 bytes, sha256 `256c883b...` (the slice198 build was 95,667,712 bytes).

Checks (2026-10-16, build `private/slice200-build/build`):

- CTest 29/29 (new: `native_memcard_store`, the atomic writer with the crash-injection cases).
- Crash-safe card, kill test (`tests/python/test_memcard_kill.py`): the fixture `memcard_store_fixture --writer <card> 0`
  rewrites a copy in two alternating complete images; the test kills it 25 times at random moments (TerminateProcess) and
  requires the card to be byte-identical to one of the two images. Passed.
- Installed paths (`tests/python/test_portable_install.py`): installed shaders and GS package found next to the
  executable; missing shader fails (exit 1); `GT4_GS_PROCESS` override reported; build-time fallback. Passed.
- Distribution (`tests/python/test_make_distribution.py`): folder content, no GS package, no game data, changed exe
  refused, output outside `private/` refused. Passed.
- Donor headless, `--mode`-equivalent command from the distribution folder (`private/slice200-dist`, see
  [DISTRIBUTION](DISTRIBUTION.md)): 42/42 frames identical to `private/slice157-smoke/headless-157/frames`, and to the
  slice199 donor run.
- pcsx2 headless from the distribution folder (`GT4_GS_PROCESS` = slice197 gt4-gs 0.4.0): 41/41 PNG dumps identical to
  the slice199 pcsx2 run; Arbitrary Code Guard on.
- Card in those runs: the menus schedule (4,200 frames, the slice157 presses) never saves. The `card.ps2` of the donor
  and pcsx2 runs is byte-identical to the seed (`b757feff...`), as is the slice199 donor run. So the headless byte
  comparison of a saved card is not available for this schedule; the save path is covered by the fixture, the kill test
  and the build. An in-game save check is the owner's test.

Path audit (`gt4vulkan.exe`): one build-machine string remains, `C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice153-pacing-shaders`
(the build-time shader fallback, kept for development builds). No pdb path, no user name. Details: [DISTRIBUTION](DISTRIBUTION.md).

Distribution: `scripts/make_distribution.py` wrote `private/slice200-dist` (16 files: `gt4vulkan.exe`, `shaders/*.spv`,
`vcruntime140.dll`, `msvcp140.dll`, `msvcp140_atomic_wait.dll`, `licenses/`, `MANIFEST.json`). No gt4-gs package, no game
data.

Worktree copies: the pinned `private/` inputs of slice200 were copied (files, no links) into `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-058-harden\private`
and checked by size and SHA-256 (16 checks; the 140-file gt4-gs package tree `e9402cf2...`). The disc image
(`Gran Turismo 4 (USA) (v2.00).iso`, 5.3 GB) is not copied: the probe checks it at the checkout root.

## Slice201 - cursor, shader notice, performance overlay, stable gt4-gs 1.0.0 (TASK-060/061/062)

Branch `task/060-062-osd` (worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-060-osd`, from main `3b5334d`), fork branch `gt4gs/osd`
(worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4recomp-gs-osd`, commit `3b9aae399`, tag `gt4gs-v1.0.0`). Same capsules, shaders, EE library
and VU tables as slice198/199; native changes only. Scripts in `private/slice201-scripts`:

- game: `build-game-201.bat [targets]` (source = the worktree, build dir `private/slice201-osd-build/build`, assets root the
  main checkout); `guard.ps1` / `guarded.sh <log> <command>` wait until no ninja, cl, clang-cl or link process runs;
- gt4-gs iteration build: `build-gt4gs-201.bat` (`GT4GS_ONLY=ON`, `private/slice201-gt4gs-build`), packaged by copying the
  new `gt4-gs.exe` over the 0.4.0 package into `private/slice201-gt4gs-devpkg` (not pinned);
- release: `release-100.sh` = `gt4gs/release-local.ps1 -Tag gt4gs-v1.0.0 -Build private\slice201-gt4gs-release-build -Deps
  private\slice193-gt4gs-deps\root\deps -OutDir private\slice201-gt4gs-release -Release` (log
  `private/slice201-release-1.0.0.log`); downloaded back to `private/slice201-gt4gs-download` and extracted to
  `private/slice201-gt4gs-release-pkg`;
- pin: `make_manifest.py <worktree> <assets root> private/slice201-gt4gs-release-pkg slice201-pcsx2.json <zip> <url>`;
  `copy_pins.py <worktree> <main checkout> slice201-pcsx2.json slice199-pcsx2.json` copies (never links) every pinned
  file, both package trees and the GS cache and data folders into the worktree's `private/` and checks them;
- checks: `headless-201.sh <run> [env]` (slice157 schedule, outputs in `private/slice201-smoke`), `cmp201.py`,
  `overhead.sh <runs>` (hidden-window overlay A/B with `tools/gs_live_check`), `ctest-201.bat`; commit hygiene
  `normalize_eol.py` (each file keeps its blob's line endings) and `check_blobs.py` (no CR CR LF, no mixed blobs).

Pins `docs/inputs/slice201-pcsx2.json` (`gt4vulkan.exe` 95,672,320 bytes, sha256 `f4737af4...`; gt4-gs 1.0.0 package tree
`c95edf1c...`); `--mode pcsx2` points here, `--mode pcsx2-slice199` keeps slice199. Fixtures (`tools/gs_live_check`):
`--cursor-check` and `--overlay-shot <bmp>` are VISIBLE (about 1-2 s, small window at a screen corner, topmost while they
run; they stop as inconclusive when another window covers them or the mouse moves); `--osd` posts synthetic OSD_STATS.

Checks: CTest 30/30; Python 455 OK, 25 skipped (`GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = the slice201 build); donor 42/42 identical to
slice157; pcsx2 1x 41/41 identical to slice199; no-JIT static check passes on the published package (23 modules).
Details: [GS-LIVE](GS-LIVE.md) section 11.

## Slice203 - gt4-gs 1.0.1 (TASK-044: no writes under Documents\PCSX2)

Game executable `private/slice203-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe` (copied from the slice202 build, same hash `d4cb6de6...`,
95,685,120 bytes). Package: the stable gt4-gs 1.0.1 release (see [GS-FORK](GS-FORK.md)), extracted to
`private/slice203-gt4gs-release-pkg` (tree `55939b2b...`). Pin `docs/inputs/slice203-pcsx2.json` (slice202 fields with the
1.0.1 `gs_stream` and `runtime_dependencies`, written as a new file); `--mode pcsx2` = slice203, `pcsx2-slice202` kept.
The test `tests/python/test_gs_slice203_pin.py` checks the pin, the release values and the copied files.

Checks: Python suite 472 run, 18 skipped (`GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = the slice202 build). CTest 29/30: `python_native_contracts`
discovers tests in the stale path `C:/Antigravity/gt4-wt-060-osd`, which does not exist any more (the slice202 build config),
so it finds nothing; it passes from the worktree (472 tests). Donor headless 4200 frames: 42/42 identical to slice202.
pcsx2 headless 4200 frames with `GT4_GS_SCALE=1 GT4_GS_ASPECT=auto` (the slice202 settings): 41/41 gs-frames identical to
slice202. no-JIT check of the 1.0.1 package: passed (`check-nojit.json` from the release script).

Documents\PCSX2: a `Documents\PCSX2` snapshot (path, size, mtime) before and after a live headless run and after an
offline `--replay-gscap` run: no changes. The offline replay stops after VM initialization with exit code -16843010, the same
point as the 1.0.0 logs (a limit of the replay test, not investigated). Not done: a clean-profile run with a redirected
USERPROFILE; the PCSX2 folder location comes from the known-folder API, so a redirect is not a reliable test.

Runs: the headless runs used the main checkout as assets root, with the slice203 build and package copied into
`private/slice203-build` and `private/slice203-gt4gs-release-pkg` there (new directories; the worktree copies are the same
files, hashes verified). The probe also reads the main checkout's own `private/fingerprint-check/CORE.GT4` and
`private/reconstructed/SCUS_973.28.elf` (not copied).

## Slice202 - TASK-058/059 and TASK-060/061/062 together, gt4-gs 1.0.0

`task/060-062-osd` merged with main `b955235` (TASK-058/059, PR #35); conflicts resolved keeping both sides
(`private/slice201-scripts/resolve_merge.py`). One game build with the slice200 recipe (port `private/slice200-port`, memcard
capsule `private/slice200-memcard-runtime`, `-DGT4_MEMCARD_RUNTIME_SOURCE`) and this source: `private/slice202-scripts/
build-game-202.bat` into `private/slice202-build/build` (`gt4vulkan.exe` 95,685,120 bytes, sha256 `d4cb6de6...`). The GS
package is the stable gt4-gs 1.0.0 of slice201 (`private/slice201-gt4gs-release-pkg`, tree `c95edf1c...`).

Pins `docs/inputs/slice202-pcsx2.json` (slice200 fields plus the slice201 `gs_stream` and runtime dependencies, written by
`private/slice202-scripts/make_manifest.py`); `--mode pcsx2` = slice202, `--mode pcsx2-slice201`, `pcsx2-slice200` and
`pcsx2-slice199` kept. The worktree holds file copies of the slice202 and slice200 pins (`copy_pins.py`, 32 checks).
Distribution: `scripts/make_distribution.py C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice202-dist ... --exe
.../slice202-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe --runtime-manifest docs/inputs/slice202-pcsx2.json` (16 files); `--portable-check`
ok (9 of 9 shaders installed); headless smoke from the folder (`private/slice202-scripts/smoke_dist.py`).

Checks (2026-10-16): CTest 30/30; Python 469 OK, 17 skipped (`GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = the slice202 build, `GT4_ASSETS_ROOT` =
the main checkout); headless from the worktree: donor 42/42 identical to slice157, pcsx2 1x 41/41 identical to slice201
(overlay off); from `private/slice202-dist`: donor 42/42, pcsx2 41/41 (gt4-gs pin matched, ACG on, 0 executable non-image
regions); no-JIT check of the 1.0.0 package as slice201.

gt4-gs and `Documents\PCSX2` (TASK-044 note): gt4-gs 1.0.0 writes under `Documents\PCSX2`: `VMManager::Internal::LoadStartupSettings()` runs before `[GT4GS] DataRoot` is applied, so it rewrites `Documents\PCSX2\logs\emulog.txt` every session (Confirmed: before/after snapshot of the folder) and creates the PCSX2 user folders there (bios, memcards, logs, ...) on a PC that has none (High confidence, `EmuFolders::EnsureFoldersExist`). The log line "MemoryCards Directory: ...Documents\PCSX2\memcards" is that early pass; the session itself uses DataRoot. Fix on fork branch `gt4gs/datadir` (commit `b30870fe8`, version 1.0.1, NOT released): the call moves after the stream folders; checked: 0 changes under `Documents\PCSX2`, emulog in DataRoot\logs. Check script:
`private/slice202-scripts/docs_check.ps1` (offline replay) and two headless live runs with a folder snapshot.

## Slice 208 - TASK-014 stage B candidate (`--mode pcsx2-coverage`)

The slice206 game with an EE library that has 1,105 accepted explicit translator entries (library profile `coverage`).
Only the library changes. `--mode pcsx2` stays on slice206. Pins: `docs/inputs/slice208-pcsx2.json` (runtime and library
hashes, measurement mode `pcsx2-coverage`) and `docs/inputs/slice208-ee-libraries.json` (library profile);
seeds `docs/inputs/slice208-ee-entries.txt` and `.json` (sha256 and expected count).

Steps (serial; fresh directories under the main checkout's `private/`):

1. Seeds: the high candidates plus the medium candidates with a decomp name from the Phase 1 ledger (1,105; see
   `docs/EE-ENTRY-LEDGER.md`).
2. Producer: `python scripts/ee_entries.py prepare --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --output C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice208-ee-entries-producer`,
   then `python scripts/ee_entries.py generate --output <same> --seed-set accepted`. The translator reports 0 rejected
   seeds, 138,813 analysis entries and 0 stop sites; 325 of 326 units change (`generation-entries.json`).
3. Library: `private/slice208-scripts/build-library.cmd` configures `tools/ee_producer` with the portable clang-cl
   23.1.2 (`private/tooling/llvm-23.1.2/bin/clang-cl.exe`) and builds `ps2game` with one worker. The 325 changed
   objects differ from production; unchanged objects match (check: 8 sampled units compiled by 23.1.2 are identical to
   the production members, timestamp-normalised). Record: `python scripts/ee_entries.py record-library --output <same> --seed-set accepted --profile coverage`.
4. Executable: `private/slice208-scripts/build-game-208.bat` (`GT4_EE_PROFILE=coverage`, the slice206 capsules, port,
   shaders and GS package). The executable uses the system clang-cl 22.1.3, the compiler that built slice206, so that the
   library is the only changed variable.

Hashes: executable `private/slice208-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe` 97,104,896 bytes, sha256 `b96c6d64...`; library
`private/slice208-ee-entries-producer/game-build/ps2game.lib` 70,694,004 bytes, sha256 `8f40b11e...`. All 16 pinned
files verified by sha256 in the main checkout.

Checks (2026-10-20): CTest 33 of 33 (`private/slice208-scripts/ctest-208-r2.log`); Python 583 OK, 23 skipped
(`GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice208 build, `GT4_ASSETS_ROOT` = main checkout). Headless, 4,200 frames, the slice157/202
12-press schedule and widescreen seed card, 42 frame dumps: slice206 (`private/slice208-smoke/base-206`) and slice208
(`private/slice208-smoke/cand-208`) are identical, 42 of 42 (per-file sha256). Neither probe log contains
"no translated code". The headless path does not show whether the 1,105 new entries run; that is the owner play-through.

Owner command (after this branch is merged): `python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode pcsx2-coverage`.

## Slice 209 - TASK-019 launcher test: `GT4_FULLSCREEN` start (`--mode pcsx2`)

The slice208 build (coverage EE library) with one native change: the game starts in borderless fullscreen when
`GT4_FULLSCREEN=1` (the launcher's Display setting, on by default). Unset, empty or `0` start windowed; any other
value stops the start with a message. The start uses the Alt+Enter path (`set_fullscreen`) after the window exists.
Pins: `docs/inputs/slice209-pcsx2.json` (measurement mode `pcsx2`). `--mode pcsx2` now selects slice209; `pcsx2-coverage`
(slice208) and `pcsx2-slice206` stay as history modes.

Source: `private/slice209-src`, a `git archive` of main 8bd113a (identical to the slice208 source, 801ee94) with four
files replaced: `native/window.cpp` (only the `open_window` start block), `native/window_mode.hpp`, `native/window_mode.cpp`
(`parse_start_fullscreen`) and `native/quickfix_fixture.cpp` (`test_start_mode_environment`). Nothing else differs, so the
window change is the only variable against slice208. The branch's `native/` also carries earlier TASK-019 native work
(`controls.cpp`, `host_io`, the icon and title in `window.cpp`, `gt4vulkan.rc`); that work is not in slice209.

Build (serial; `private/slice209-scripts/build-game-209.bat`, log `build-game-209.log`): the slice208 recipe with
`GT4_EE_PROFILE=coverage`, the slice200 port, slice153 shaders, slice191 runtime, slice206 license guard, clang-cl 22.1.3
(`C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-cl.exe`) inside the VS x64 environment. Executable `private/slice209-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`,
97,105,408 bytes, sha256 `a75c58faec60d41c...` (slice208: 97,104,896 bytes, `b96c6d64...`). The coverage library
`private/slice208-ee-entries-producer/game-build/ps2game.lib` is the pinned file (sha256 `8f40b11e...`), unchanged.

Checks (2026-10-20):
- CTest 33 of 33 (`private/slice209-scripts/ctest-209.log`). The `native_quickfix` fixture covers the start values: unset,
  empty and `0` start windowed; `1` starts fullscreen; `true`, `on` and `2` are refused.
- Python `unittest discover` with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = the slice209 build and `GT4_ASSETS_ROOT` = the main checkout:
  589 OK, 23 skipped (`private/slice209-scripts/python-209.log`).
- Headless, 4,200 frames, the slice208 arguments (12 presses, widescreen seed card, `--frames-dir`, `--frame-every 100`,
  `GT4_MTVU_REPORT_EVERY=500`): 42 of 42 frame dumps identical to slice208 (`private/slice209-smoke/cand-209`
  against `private/slice208-smoke/cand-208`, per-file sha256). No `no translated code` line.
- The headless path never calls `open_window`, so the live fullscreen start is not covered by these runs; it is the owner's
  launcher test.
- Pins: the 23 pinned files of `docs/inputs/slice209-pcsx2.json` were checked by size and sha256 in the main checkout
  (runtime, library, port, shaders, runtime dependencies, memcard and license guard capsules, card seeds, VU0 image,
  gt4-gs package file list not recomputed here: unchanged from slice203).

Owner launcher test folder (`private/owner-test-launcher`): `game` is slice209 (16 files: `gt4vulkan.exe`,
`shaders/`, `licenses/`, the three VC runtime DLLs, `MANIFEST.json` with runtime manifest `slice209-pcsx2.json`), built with
`scripts/make_distribution.py` in a fresh `game-209` and renamed. The slice206 folder is `game-206-old`. `GT4Recomp.exe`
and `version.json` were not touched.

Owner command: `python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode pcsx2`.

## Slice 210 - TASK-075 (game side) and TASK-076: SDL3 gamepads and the keyboard table (`--mode pcsx2`)

The slice209 build with the SDL3 gamepad layer and the TASK-076 keyboard table. Nothing else changes: guest code, EE
library (coverage), port (slice200), shaders (slice153), runtime capsule (slice191), license guard (slice206) and the
memory card capsule are the same. Pins: `docs/inputs/slice210-pcsx2.json` (measurement mode `pcsx2`) and
`docs/inputs/slice210-sdl3.json`. `--mode pcsx2` selects slice210; `pcsx2-slice209` stays as history.

SDL3 (zlib): the official SDL 3.4.18 Windows packages from the GitHub release `release-3.4.18`, fetched with
`gh release download`. Their sha256 equals GitHub's asset digest:

- `SDL3-devel-3.4.18-VC.zip` sha256 `78d84602ae616cfe26b33a73b7d3b9b6b56e8a6650e53d92c9c6ca938f747acd`
- `SDL3-3.4.18-win32-x64.zip` sha256 `75c2c0fc74e7d1206aaedc22893a35887332f4f85f5c8b74fddc10d177985f2c`

Extracted, not committed, to `private/tooling/sdl3-3.4.18/devel` (headers, `lib/x64/SDL3.lib`, licence) and
`private/tooling/sdl3-3.4.18/runtime` (`SDL3.dll`). `native/CMakeLists.txt` (`gt4_sdl3`) checks the import library,
`SDL3.dll` and the licence against the pin at configure time. Each executable that loads SDL (`gt4vulkan`,
`host_io_fixture`) gets `SDL3.dll` copied beside it by a POST_BUILD step. `scripts/make_distribution.py` ships the DLL
and `licenses/LICENSE-SDL3.txt`.

Source: this branch (`task/075-sdl3-input`, from `task/019-launcher` f64f723). Build script
`private/slice210-scripts/build-game-210.bat`: the slice209 recipe with the source `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-075`, the
`GT4_SDL3_ROOT` pin, clang-cl 22.1.3 (`C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-cl.exe`) in the VS x64 environment, serial
build. Executable `private/slice210-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 97,184,768 bytes, sha256 `561a5e15...`.

Changes against slice209: `native/pad_mapping.{hpp,cpp}` (new, pure mapping), `native/host_io.{hpp,cpp}` (SDL3 backend;
the XInput path stays under `GT4_INPUT=xinput`), `native/window.cpp` (`GT4_INPUT`), `native/controls.cpp` (keyboard
defaults), `native/CMakeLists.txt` (SDL3 pin, link, DLL copy, `pad_mapping_fixture`; the duplicated `gt4_memcard` block
on the launcher branch is removed, it stopped configure), `native/host_io_fixture.cpp` (quiet loader errors),
`scripts/external_runtime_probe.py` (quiet loader errors on game launches). Also on the branch since TASK-019 and not in
slice209: `controls.cpp`, the window icon and title.

Checks (2026-10-20/21):

- CTest: `private/slice210-scripts/ctest-210.log`.
- Python `unittest discover` with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = `private/slice210-build/build`: 589 tests OK, 41 skipped
  (`private/slice210-scripts/python-210.log`). The `FAIL:` lines in that log are subtest messages of the existing GS
  option tests; the run reports OK.
- Headless, 4,200 frames, the slice208 arguments (12 presses, widescreen seed card, `--frames-dir`, `--frame-every 100`,
  `GT4_MTVU_REPORT_EVERY=500`, no `--window`): 42 of 42 frame dumps identical to slice209
  (`private/slice210-smoke/cand-210` against `private/slice209-smoke/cand-209`, per-file sha256). No `no translated code`
  line. The headless path never creates the controller, so SDL is not started there.
- Pins: all 16 files of `docs/inputs/slice210-pcsx2.json` and the SDL3 library, DLL, licence and 86 headers of
  `docs/inputs/slice210-sdl3.json` checked by size and sha256 in the main checkout.

Owner launcher test folder (`private/owner-test-launcher`): `game` is slice210, made by `scripts/make_distribution.py`
in `game-210` and renamed (18 files, including `SDL3.dll` and `licenses/LICENSE-SDL3.txt`); the slice209 folder is
`game-209-old`. `GT4Recomp.exe`, `version.json` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` were not touched.

Owner command: `python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode pcsx2`.

## Slice 211 - TASK-079 force 16:9 at boot (`--mode pcsx2`)

The slice210 build plus `GT4_FORCE_WIDESCREEN`: the game's own Wide setting is held at 16:9 at every guest VBlank.
Source: this branch (`task/079-force-widescreen`, from `task/075-sdl3-input` 85b63cd). Build script
`private/slice211-scripts/build-game-211.bat` (the slice210 recipe, source `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-079`, clang-cl 22.1.3
as slice206-slice210). Executable `private/slice211-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 97,186,816 bytes, sha256 `2fecda70...`.

Changes against slice210:
- `native/race_widescreen.{hpp,cpp}` (new, pure logic plus two entry points). It holds three guest words, all range-checked:
  the wide flag `owner + 0x38CC4` (= option + 0x14, set to 1); the aspect record `option + 0x24` (11 words, copied from the
  wide preset `0x622EC0`, or `0x622F20` for NTSC, when the record is not wide); the published word `0x6184F0` (D_006184F0,
  set to 1 when the record is wide). A wide preset that is not wide is refused with no write. Option = `owner + 0x38CB0`.
- `native/mtvu_runtime.cpp` `vblank_sync`: calls the hold at the top, so it runs at every guest VBlank in windowed and
  headless runs (the donor's `system.cpp` calls `gt4::mtvu::vblank_sync()` before `on_vblank`). The window's `on_vblank`
  is not used for it: `run_window` is never reached headless, and a static initializer for `g_options.on_vblank` was
  overwritten by the dynamic initialization of `Options` (std::string members). `native/CMakeLists.txt`: `gt4_mtvu_runtime`
  links `gt4_quickfix`.
- `native/window.cpp`: validates `GT4_FORCE_WIDESCREEN` at window start (invalid value: refused, exit before guest work).
- Fixture `native_race_widescreen` (CTest), `tests/python/test_race_widescreen.py` (launcher env, mode pin, ELF records).
- `scripts/external_runtime_probe.py`: `GT4_FORCE_WIDESCREEN` validated (unset means 1; `0` and `1` only), forwarded and
  recorded as `force_widescreen_environment`. `PERF_PROFILES['pcsx2']` is slice211; `pcsx2-slice210` is history.

Pinned ELF facts (checked in `private/reconstructed/SCUS_973.28.elf`): the wide and 4:3 preset sources at `0x6A61B8` and
`0x6A6188` are 425 x 240 and 275 x 205 (func_00439B30 initialises the presets from them).

Checks (2026-10-21):
- CTest: the new fixture and all other tests were run; `python_native_contracts` failed on an autocrlf artifact
  (`docs/inputs/slice208-ee-entries.txt` in the working copy) and on a pin test that was updated (slice 211). The
  worktree copy was restored from the committed LF blob.
- Python `unittest discover` with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice211: see `private/slice211-scripts/python-211-final.log`.
- Headless, 4,200 frames, the slice210 arguments (12 presses, frame dump every 100, `--trace-syscalls`,
  `GT4_MTVU_REPORT_EVERY=500`), 42 frame dumps each:
  - (a) widescreen seed card (`private/slice113-video/widescreen-seed/card.ps2`), `GT4_FORCE_WIDESCREEN=0`: 42 of 42
    identical to slice210 (`private/slice210-smoke/cand-210`, per-file sha256).
  - (a2) the same, unset (force on): 42 of 42 identical to (a). The 16:9 card is unchanged by the hold.
  - (c) 4:3 candidate card (`private/slice110-menu-pilot/name-control4/card.ps2`, a copy, `GT4_FORCE_WIDESCREEN=0`):
    36 of 42 frames differ from (a) (title screen).
  - (d) the same 4:3 copy, unset (force on): 3 of 42 frames differ from (c) (frames 700, 800, 900, the title transition);
    the log shows `wide flag set to 16:9 at guest 0x009A7024 (owner 0x0096E360, ntsc 0)`. 35 of 42 frames still differ
    from (a).
  - Limit found: the headless schedule stays on the title screen, so no race, HUD or photo frame is compared. The
    16:9 state of the native seed card includes more than the three words held here; the remaining state is not identified.
    The owner's in-game test is the decision point.
- Pins: `docs/inputs/slice211-pcsx2.json` (runtime `private/slice211-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 97,186,816 bytes, sha256
  `2fecda70...`). Every other pin is unchanged.

Owner launcher test folder (`private/owner-test-launcher`): `game` is slice211 (`make_distribution.py`, 18 files including
`SDL3.dll` and `licenses/LICENSE-SDL3.txt`); the slice210 folder is `game-210-old`; `GT4Recomp.exe` is the TASK-079 launcher
build (`launcher/target/release/GT4Recomp.exe` on `task/019-launcher`). `version.json` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` untouched.

Owner command: `python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode pcsx2`.

## Slice 212b - TASK-080 P1 native display aspect ratios (`--mode pcsx2`)

The slice211 build plus native aspect ratios (decision [0071](decisions/0071-native-aspect-ratios-runtime-hooks.md),
design [ULTRAWIDE-NATIVE-STUDY](ULTRAWIDE-NATIVE-STUDY.md)). Source: branch `task/080-aspect-ratios` (from main 26f83b8),
worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-080`. Build script `private/slice212b-scripts/build-game-212b.bat` (the slice211 recipe,
clang-cl 22.1.3, serial) with `GT4_LICENSE_GUARD_SOURCE=private/slice212c-license-guard-runtime`. Executable
`private/slice212b-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 97,197,056 bytes, sha256 `d222a64772cba742...`. Game library, port,
shaders, runtime and memcard capsules, VU tables and the gt4-gs 1.0.1 package are the slice211 inputs.
(`private/slice212-scripts` and `private/slice212-smoke` belong to an earlier investigation; `private/slice212b-license-guard-runtime`
is a first derivation without the RaceDisplay::render marker, never pinned or shipped.)

Changes against slice211:
- `native/display_aspect.{hpp,cpp}` (new, in `gt4_quickfix`): `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT` (unset/`auto` = the game window's
  client area, followed on WM_SIZE and Alt+Enter, 16:9 headless; `16:9`, `4:3`, `W:H`, or a decimal 0.5..8; anything
  else refuses the start) and the hidden `GT4_ASPECT_FOV_EXTRA` (0.5..3.0, default 1.0); 16:9 snap within 0.5%;
  Hor+/Vert+ factors; the matrix scale; the scene policy and the runtime glue.
- Capsule `private/slice212c-license-guard-runtime` (`scripts/prepare_license_guard.py --display-aspect`, overlay
  `scripts/display_aspect_overlay.inc` on top of the slice206 guard; pin `docs/inputs/slice212c-license-guard-runtime.json`;
  kernel.cpp and cdvdfsv.cpp byte-identical to slice206). Two hook lines in `dispatch`:
  - the race camera call of `RaceBase::initMonitor` (return label 0x00388B38, a1 = sp = the 4x4 monitor matrix): Hor+
    for R >= 16:9 scales the x output column (m[0], m[4], m[8], m[12]) by (16/9)/(R f); Vert+ below 16:9 scales the y
    column by R/(16/9) and x by 1/f. Nothing is written when the factor is 1. a1 must equal sp. Photo pause
    (`func_003C49C8`) reaches the same call;
  - every dispatch of `RaceDisplay::render` (0x0039F498, the race HUD, only reached through vtables) marks the race view.
- Scene policy: race view = the HUD rendered in the last 30 VBlanks and no photo/movie display request (row 2 of
  `func_001074D0`, struct 0x006184D0; cleared by the next camera hook or request); 3-VBlank hysteresis. The first plan
  (requests only) failed in the headless race trace: 480i races and menus make identical requests.
- Presentation: CoreGS 1.1 fills a rectangle of the race projection ratio with linear filtering in the race view
  (`native_vulkan.cpp` `presentation_rect_ratio`, `set_race_view_presentation`), 16:9 pillarbox and nearest elsewhere.
  PCSX2 GS: protocol 1.3 producer, CONTROL kind 7 `display_aspect` (mode 0 game aspect, 1 fill) after a VSYNC when the
  mode changes, only to a consumer whose READY minor is 3 or more (`docs/GS-STREAM-PROTOCOL.md` 1.3; header
  `kVersionMinor = 3`, `ErrorCode::bad_argument = 7`). Nothing is ever sent while the projection ratio is 16:9.
- TASK-079 hardening (`native/race_widescreen.*`): the hold writes only after the game-data pointer settled (moved from
  the boot object and stable 30 VBlanks; 600 VBlanks if no move is seen). Headless: pointer 0 -> 0x0096E360 at VBlank 12,
  -> 0x00A0CC10 at VBlank 20, settled at 50; the boot object is no longer written. Card I/O is not visible to the host
  (it would need a new memcard capsule); not detected.
- `native/window.cpp` (validation at start, client size, presentation sink), `native/mtvu_runtime.cpp` (VBlank tick),
  `scripts/external_runtime_probe.py` (validation, forwarding and `display_aspect_environment`; mode `pcsx2` = slice212b,
  `pcsx2-slice211` history), tests (`native_display_aspect`, fixtures in `native_race_widescreen`, `native_gs_stream_client`
  1.3 scenario, `vulkan_fixture` ratio rectangles, `tests/python/test_display_aspect.py`).

Checks (2026-10-21):
- CTest 37 of 37 (`private/slice212b-scripts/ctest-212b-final.log`).
- Python `unittest discover`, `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice212b: 612 tests OK, 23 skipped (`python-212b.log`).
- Headless donor runs (`private/slice212b-scripts/run-headless-212b.sh`, stderr filtered on the fly because the
  `--trace-syscalls` log is about 1 GB per race run):
  - (a) menus, 4,200 frames, widescreen seed copy, `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT=16:9`: 42 of 42 dumps identical to slice211 (b, force on).
  - (b) the same, unset (auto, headless 16:9): 42 of 42 identical.
  - (d) menus, 4:3 card copy (name-control4), auto: 42 of 42 identical to slice211 (d3): the hardened hold gives the same frames.
  - (c) race schedule (Arcade, El Capitan, Ford Ka, 5 AI; 16,000 frames, the TASK-041 presses), 4:3 card copy:
    16:9 = no write, no presentation change; 21:9 and 32:9: 84 of 160 dumps differ from 16:9, the first at frame 7700
    (camera hook at VBlank 7638 and 8335, matrix at sp 0x01FFF810 / 0x01FFF800, x factor 0.761905 = 16/21 and 0.5;
    HUD from VBlank 7667, fill from 7670, no pillarbox gap with the 30-VBlank window). Run dirs `private/slice212b-smoke/f-*`. Also 4:3 (y 0.75) and 32:9 with `GT4_ASPECT_FOV_EXTRA=1.25` (x 0.4).
- Headless pcsx2 (probe, race schedule 10,000 frames, `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT=21:9`): gt4-gs 1.0.1 (protocol 1.2, the pinned
  package, same exe as `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp\gs\1.0.1`): no CONTROL display_aspect sent ("needs 1.3" logged once),
  exit 0; gt4-gs 1.1.0 (protocol 1.3, `private/gt4gs-110-release-pkg`, read only): "CONTROL display_aspect 1 (fill) from
  frame 7670", no ERROR, exit 0.
- Pins: `docs/inputs/slice212b-pcsx2.json` (runtime above; license guard fields = slice212c) and
  `docs/inputs/slice212c-license-guard-runtime.json`; every other input as slice211.

Owner command: `python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode pcsx2`
(set `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT` / `GT4_ASPECT_FOV_EXTRA` before it to test).
## Slice 213 - TASK-081 release build for 1.0.0 (`--mode pcsx2`)

The slice211 recipe plus `-DGT4_RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=ON`. Source: branch `task/081-release-1-0-0` (from main 26f83b8).
Build script `private/slice213-scripts/build-game-213.bat` (clang-cl 22.1.3 as slice206-slice211, `--parallel 4`).
Executable `private/slice213-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 97,188,352 bytes, sha256
`c503ee9c0729a9e0acc606762a0cb79c130829e311a771ac284e25a63c27422b`.

Changes against slice211:
- `native/CMakeLists.txt`: option `GT4_RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION` (default OFF). ON sets `GT4_VULKAN_SHADER_DIR` to an empty
  string and copies the nine shaders of the pinned capsule into `<build>\shaders` after `gt4vulkan` links.
- `native/install_paths.{hpp,cpp}`: with an empty build-time folder the answer is always `<exe folder>\shaders`;
  `--portable-check` prints `build-time shader fallback: present (development build)` or `none (release build)`.
- `native/native_vulkan.cpp`: a missing shader folder stops Vulkan start with "The game's shader folder is missing
  (...). Reinstall GT4Recomp." (windowed runs print it as `[host] audio/input/window failure: ...`; a headless run
  ends without the text, as for every other Vulkan start error).
- CPU level: unchanged. `GT4_X86_64_V3` stays OFF. A disassembly of slice211 (llvm-objdump) finds 346 SSE4/AVX
  instructions, all in one 12 KB region of CPU-dispatched Visual C++ library code (`cpuid` x5, `xgetbv` x1), and no
  BMI1/BMI2 instruction. The executable runs on baseline x86-64; the launcher checks SSE4.1 (owner, slice214 round), so the
  game has no CPU check of its own (Confirmed for slice211 and the same recipe in slice213).

Checks (2026-10-21):
- String scan of `gt4vulkan.exe` (ASCII and UTF-16 runs of 5+ characters; drive paths, `Antigravity`, `Alano`,
  `gt4-wt`, `Users\`, `staticrecomp`, `private\slice`, `.cargo`, `AppData`): no match. slice211 had exactly one
  (`C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice153-pacing-shaders`).
- CTest: `private/slice213-scripts/ctest-213.log`.
- Python `unittest discover` with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice213: `private/slice213-scripts/python-213.log`.
- Headless, 4,200 frames, the slice211 arguments (12 presses, frame dump every 100, `--trace-syscalls`,
  `GT4_MTVU_REPORT_EVERY=500`), a copy of the widescreen seed card, `GT4_FORCE_WIDESCREEN` unset:
  42 of 42 frame dumps identical to slice211 runs (a), (a2) and (b) (`private/slice213-smoke/h213-seed-unset`,
  `private/slice213-scripts/sha-213.txt`). No `no translated code` line. The card copy is unchanged. The log shows
  `[vulkan] shader folder: ...\slice213-build\build\shaders` (the build-tree copy).
- Without `shaders\` (scratch copy of the distribution folder): `--portable-check` says `missing; a release build has
  no build-time fallback` and exits 1; the game start stops at Vulkan start.
- Distribution folder `private/slice213-dist` (`scripts/make_distribution.py`, 18 files, 97 MB): `--portable-check`
  `result: ok`, `build-time shader fallback: none (release build)`.
- Pins: `docs/inputs/slice213-pcsx2.json` (mode `pcsx2`; `pcsx2-slice211` kept as history). Every other pin is
  unchanged.

Owner command: `python scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode pcsx2`.
The installer (TASK-081) packs `private/slice213-dist` as `game\`.

## Slice 214 - TASK-081 round 2: Vulkan baseline path for older drivers (`--mode pcsx2`)

Release blocker: slice213 required `VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2` and `VK_KHR_surface_maintenance1` (instance) and
`VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1` (device), which only 2025+ drivers have. slice214 = the slice213 recipe
(`private/slice214-scripts/build-game-214.bat`) plus:
- `native/vulkan_extensions.{hpp,cpp}` (pure): required = `VK_KHR_surface`, `VK_KHR_win32_surface` (instance) and
  `VK_KHR_swapchain` (device). Swapchain maintenance 1 is enabled only when present: the KHR family (2025+), else the
  EXT family (2023+, same structures and values), each with `VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2` and its own
  `surface_maintenance1`, and only when the device reports the `swapchainMaintenance1` feature.
  `GT4_VULKAN_FORCE_BASELINE=1` forces the plain path; any value other than 0 or 1 refuses the start.
- `native/native_vulkan.cpp`: enumerates instance and device extensions; the feature query chains the maintenance
  structure only when offered; timeline semaphores (core 1.2) stay required. Baseline path: a slot waits on the GS
  timeline value of its last presenting submission instead of a present fence; each swapchain image has its own present
  semaphore (recreated with the swapchain); `vkDeviceWaitIdle` before a swapchain rebuild and at shutdown. The startup
  log says `[vulkan] presentation path: khr-maintenance1 | ext-maintenance1 | baseline (...)`.
- CTest: `native_vulkan_extensions` (selection table) and `native_vulkan_pixels_baseline` (the pixel fixture, including
  Win32 presentation to a hidden window with repeat, zero size and resize, on the forced baseline path).

Executable `private/slice214-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 97,197,568 bytes, sha256
`77909fa6c9f6ea832c204136b118a8da559718ec72a231d3d1601beb60e36150`. String scan: no build path.

Checks (2026-10-21):
- CTest 38/38 (`private/slice214-scripts/ctest-214.log`); Python 596 OK, 24 skipped (`python-214.log`).
- `vulkan_fixture` under `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` (Vulkan SDK 1.4.341.1), both paths: no validation message.
- Headless, the slice213 arguments on a copy of the widescreen seed card: default path (`khr-maintenance1` on this AMD
  driver) 42/42 and forced baseline 42/42 frame dumps identical to slice213 (`private/slice214-smoke/h214-default`,
  `h214-baseline`). Headless runs never present, so the baseline difference is limited to presentation, which the
  hidden-window CTest and the owner check.
- Pins: `docs/inputs/slice214-pcsx2.json` (mode `pcsx2`; `pcsx2-slice213` kept). Distribution `private/slice214-dist`.
- Launcher (same round): the CPU minimum is SSE4.1 with SSE3/SSSE3 (owner decision), and the Vulkan check requires only
  `VK_KHR_surface` and `VK_KHR_win32_surface`.

## Slice 215 - TASK-080 native aspect ratios on the 1.0.0 release recipe (`--mode pcsx2`)

The slice214 recipe (release distribution switch on, Vulkan baseline path) with the TASK-080 work of slice212b on top.
Source: branch `task/080-aspect-ratios` after merging main db99f9e (release 1.0.0), worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-080`.
Build script `private/slice215-scripts/build-game-215.bat` = `build-game-214.bat` with the worktree source and
`GT4_LICENSE_GUARD_SOURCE=private/slice212c-license-guard-runtime` (clang-cl 22.1.3, `--parallel 4`). Executable
`private/slice215-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe`, 97,207,808 bytes, sha256
`3c9c252d6ac68b675290da55d7390b29978b2e1db4968f23e05ac8c0765b305a`; `SDL3.dll` and `shaders\` beside it.
String scan (ASCII and UTF-16: `Antigravity`, `Alano`, `gt4-wt`, `Users\`, `staticrecomp`, `private\slice`,
`private/slice`, `.cargo`, `AppData`): no match.

Game-side changes against slice214: exactly the slice212b list (display_aspect, the slice212c capsule hooks, race-view
fill, protocol 1.3 producer, TASK-079 settle rule). `GT4_FORCE_WIDESCREEN` stays on: the game's own 16:9 is the base
and Hor+/Vert+ is applied on top of it. The gt4-gs.ini aspect stays forced 16:9; the per-scene fill reaches gt4-gs only
through protocol 1.3 `display_aspect`.

Launcher (same branch): the Aspect ratio row (Auto / 16:9 / 4:3 / Custom, Custom ratio 1.00-6.00) is the only aspect
control; Input resolution and Widescreen stay retired (`GT4_FORCE_480P=1`, `GT4_FORCE_WIDESCREEN=1` always).
Settings schema 4 migrates the 1.0.0 schema 3 file (drops `input_resolution`, `widescreen`, `[gs] aspect`; adds
`aspect_ratio = "auto"`, `aspect_custom = "233"`; see [MIGRATIONS](launcher/MIGRATIONS.md)). The hidden owner test knob
`GT4_ASPECT_FOV_EXTRA` is passed through from the launcher's environment (`launch::PASSED_THROUGH`); every other
inherited `GT4_`/`PS2_` variable is still scrubbed.

Checks (2026-10-21):
- CTest 39/39 (`private/slice215-scripts/ctest-215-final.log`); Python `unittest discover` with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` =
  slice215: 616 tests OK, 24 skipped (`python-215.log`); `cargo test --workspace` 256 passed; UI nav-test 150/150,
  focus-check 93/93 (headless Edge).
- Headless donor runs (`private/slice215-scripts/run-headless-215.sh`, stderr filtered on the fly; card copies only):
  - menus, 4,200 frames, widescreen seed copy: `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT=16:9` and unset (auto, headless 16:9): 42 of 42
    dumps identical to slice214 (`private/slice214-smoke/h214-default`); the card copy is unchanged.
  - race schedule (Arcade, El Capitan, Ford Ka, 5 AI; 16,000 frames), 4:3 card copy: 21:9 and 32:9 runs are 160 of 160
    identical to the slice212b runs; 84 of 160 differ from the 16:9 race, the first at frame 7700. Camera hook at VBlank
    7638 and 8335 (matrix at sp 0x01FFF810 / 0x01FFF800, x factor 0.761905 and 0.5), fill from VBlank 7670.
- Headless pcsx2 (probe, race schedule 10,000 frames, `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT=21:9`, pin `slice215-pcsx2.json`):
  gt4-gs 1.0.1 (the pinned package): "protocol 1.2: display aspect mode 1 not sent (needs 1.3)", exit 0;
  gt4-gs 1.1.0 (`private/gt4gs-110-release-pkg`, gt4-gs.exe sha256 48ecec53... = the exe in the published zip
  cd07f5a2...): "CONTROL display_aspect 1 (fill) from frame 7670", no ERROR, exit 0. Both gt4-gs.ini files say
  `AspectRatio = 16:9`. The 0.9 GB probe logs were reduced to `probe-filtered.log`.
- Distribution `private/slice215-dist` (`scripts/make_distribution.py`, 18 files): `--portable-check` `result: ok`.
- Pins: `docs/inputs/slice215-pcsx2.json` (mode `pcsx2`; `pcsx2-slice214`, `pcsx2-slice213`, `pcsx2-slice212b`,
  `pcsx2-slice211` kept as history). License guard fields = slice212c; every other input as slice214.

Owner test installer (not a release): `private/release-110-test-out/GT4Recomp-Setup-ultrawide-test.exe`, 28,733,896
bytes, sha256 `18dad203399dddd8ded9c2d9ebdbf7b3ad8dc3428fe75beea0bd34d3ecf83f46` (the 1.0.0 recipe of
[RELEASES](RELEASES.md): `launcher/tools/build-release.ps1`, GT4Recomp.exe sha256 744c19dd..., path scan clean; the
1.0.0 WebView2 bootstrapper receipt `private/release-100-webview2`; `makensis /DVERSION=1.0.0`). The launcher refuses
SemVer pre-release tags, so the app version stays 1.0.0 and only the file name says "ultrawide-test": the updater never
offers it, and an installed 1.0.0 is not offered an update by it. 7-Zip extraction: launcher and game executable equal
to their sources. No GitHub release, draft or tag.

## Slice 217 - TASK-080 P2: race HUD at other aspect ratios (`--mode pcsx2`)

slice217 = the slice215 recipe with three changes: the license guard capsule `private/slice217-license-guard-runtime`
(`scripts/prepare_license_guard.py ... --display-aspect`, profile `task017-guard-v2+task080-aspect-v2`: the
`RaceDisplay::render` marker also runs the HUD canvas hook on a0), the P2 host code (`native/display_aspect.*`: HUD canvas
hook, HUD parameter block at guest 0x7F00, split screen pillarboxed; `gs_stream_client`: fill target in `args[1]`) and
the EE library profile `aspect`.

EE library `aspect` (decision 0071 P2 table; `scripts/aspect_elf_patch.py`):
1. `python scripts/aspect_elf_patch.py produce --assets-root C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp --output C:/Antigravity/gt4-staticrecomp/private/slice217-ee-aspect-producer`
   (`ee_producer.py prepare`, the verified ELF sha256 `10f82e22...`, the patched derivative `SCUS_973.28.aspect.elf`
   sha256 `f10a568f...`, the slice208 accepted seed set and translator; 138,813 entries as slice208; changed units
   `unit_008F.cpp` and `unit_00A7.cpp`, one line each: `set32(c.r[8], ld32((0u + 32516u)))` for `640u` and
   `set32(c.r[1], ld32((0u + 32512u)))` for `0x3F400000u`).
2. `private/slice217-scripts/build-library-217.cmd` (the slice208 recipe: `tools/ee_producer`, portable clang-cl 23.1.2,
   one worker, about 11 minutes).
3. `python scripts/aspect_elf_patch.py record-library --output <same>`: `ps2game.lib` 70,693,756 bytes, sha256
   `8e671a10667cdb3e20ad70367fe4021763309446cd525fc6c5f8d0dec57c129b`; changed objects against the slice208 library:
   exactly `unit_008F.cpp.obj` and `unit_00A7.cpp.obj`. Pin `docs/inputs/slice217-ee-libraries.json`; CMake
   `-DGT4_EE_PROFILE=aspect`.

Game: `private/slice217-scripts/build-game-217.bat <build dir> aspect` (clang-cl 22.1.3, release distribution, the
slice215 inputs otherwise). `private/slice217-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe` 97,212,416 bytes, sha256
`593803cd6281431d7aab038fd1fcb300a20863796b7077d9f29bc2db9b49ec2b`; `SDL3.dll` and `shaders\` beside it. String scan
(ASCII and UTF-16 of `Antigravity`, `Alano`, `gt4-wt`, `Users\`, `staticrecomp`, `private\slice`, `private/slice`,
`.cargo`, `AppData`): no match. An experiment build with the slice208 library (`slice217x1`, canvas hook only) showed
the dials fixed and the text and mirror still stretched; it was deleted after the check.

Checks (2026-10-21):
- CTest 39/39 (`private/slice217-scripts/ctest-217.log`); Python with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice217: 627 tests OK,
  24 skipped (`python-217.log`); new: `tests/python/test_aspect_elf_patch.py`, HUD canvas harness tests, fixture
  `test_hud_canvas` / `test_hud_parameters`, letterbox rectangles 1920x1080 at 2.44 and 32:9, fill target 2,440,000.
- Headless donor runs (`private/slice217-scripts/run-all-headless-217.sh`, card copies only):
  - menus 16:9 and auto (widescreen seed copy): 42 of 42 identical to slice215; the card copy is unchanged;
  - race 16:9 (4:3 card copy, race schedule, 16,000 frames): 160 of 160 identical to slice212b `f-c-race-16x9` (the
    hook writes nothing; the parameter block holds 0.75 and 640);
  - race 21:9, 2.44, 32:9, 16:10: HUD canvas -240..880, -265.6..905.6, -533.3..1173.3, and top/bottom
    506.7/-26.7 (16:10, Vert+); parameter block 0x3F124925/840, 0x3F0BE406/878, 0x3EC00000/1280, 0x3F555555/640.
  - Tachometer dial (template match against the 16:9 frame, frames 9000 and 10000; aspect = presented width / height
    relative to 16:9; the 16:9 frame against itself gives 1.005 / 1.010, the method's own bias): 21:9 1.010 / 1.010,
    2.44 1.010 / 1.010, 32:9 1.005 / 1.000 (slice215 P1: 21:9 1.313 / 1.320, the stretch s = 1.3125); pivot 0.213
    screen heights right of the screen centre at every ratio, as at 16:9 (P1: 0.279 at 21:9, 0.425 at 32:9). 16:10
    (frame 9000): 0.896 x 0.891 of the 16:9 size, aspect 1.005 (the 16:9 box shrinks to fit the narrower screen).
- Headless pcsx2 (probe, pins verified, race 10,000 frames, 21:9): gt4-gs 1.0.1 (pinned) gets no kind 7; gt4-gs 1.1.0
  logs "CONTROL display_aspect 1 (fill) from frame 7670", no ERROR (it accepts the new `args[1]` and ignores it). The
  0.9 GB probe logs were reduced to `probe-filtered.log`.
- Distribution `private/slice217-dist` (18 files): `--portable-check` `result: ok`.
- Pins: `docs/inputs/slice217-pcsx2.json` (mode `pcsx2`; `pcsx2-slice215` kept as history),

slice215; the slice215 installer moved to `superseded-slice215\`). Portable copy: the installer extracted with 7-Zip into
`private/ultrawide-test-portable` (no `$PLUGINSDIR`, no uninstaller; game executable sha256 593803cd...). No GitHub
release, draft or tag.

## Slice 218 - TASK-080 addendum: seamless display (`--mode pcsx2`)

slice218 = the slice217 recipe (license guard capsule `private/slice217-license-guard-runtime`, EE library profile
`aspect`, port slice200, shaders slice153, gt4-gs 1.0.1 package, SDL3) with new host code only (decision 0071 addendum):

- `native/display_aspect.*`: `GT4_OUTPUT_SIZE=WxH` (each side 320..16384, ratio 1:2..8:1, anything else refuses the
  start); with `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT` auto (or unset) the ratio is the output size's, fixed for the session, also headless.
  A fixed `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT` still wins (developer knob).
- `native/window.cpp`, `native/window_mode.*`: `GT4_MONITOR` (a GDI device name such as `\\.\DISPLAY2`; malformed
  refuses the start, not connected falls back to the primary monitor with a log line); with either variable set the
  process declares per-monitor DPI awareness v2, the windowed client area is the output size (shrunk with its shape to
  the work area) centred on that monitor, and borderless fullscreen covers that monitor. Without both variables the
  window starts as before (960x540 where Windows puts it).

Build: `private/slice218-scripts/build-game-218.bat <build dir> aspect` (the slice217 script with the same inputs).
`private/slice218-build/build/gt4vulkan.exe` 97,221,120 bytes, sha256
`e96f3549108d7943d9d5544fddb1584f4e5327599aec1209910e7a7b82b6881e`; `SDL3.dll` and `shaders\` beside it.

Checks (2026-10-21):
- CTest 39/39 (`private/slice218-scripts/ctest-218.log`; new fixture checks: `GT4_OUTPUT_SIZE` parsing and the auto
  ratio, `GT4_MONITOR` parsing, client fit and centring). Python with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice218: 629 tests OK,
  24 skipped (`python-218.log`; new: overlay harness `test_output_size_drives_auto` and the refusal, probe validators
  for `GT4_OUTPUT_SIZE` and `GT4_MONITOR`).
- Headless donor runs (`private/slice218-scripts/run-all-headless-218.sh`, `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT` unset = auto with
  `GT4_OUTPUT_SIZE`, card copies only; stderr filtered on the fly, logs under 5 KB):
  - 1920x1080 menus (widescreen seed copy): 42 of 42 frame dumps identical to slice217 `m-16x9`;
  - 1920x1080 race (4:3 card copy, race schedule, 16,000 frames): 160 of 160 identical to slice217 `r-16x9`; camera
    hooks at VBlank 7638 and 8335 "unchanged", parameter block 0.75 / 640;
  - 2560x1080 race: auto 21.33:9 (2.3704); hook 1 at VBlank 7638 scaled x 0.750000; parameter block 0x3F100000 / 853;

- Pins: `docs/inputs/slice218-pcsx2.json` (mode `pcsx2`; `pcsx2-slice217` kept as history); all 18 pinned files
  verified by size and sha256 in the main checkout.

Launcher (same branch): `gt4l-core::display` (`display_plan`, monitor identifiers and resolving), settings schema 5,
Monitor / Resolution / Render scale rows, `GT4_MONITOR` and `GT4_OUTPUT_SIZE`, `upscale_multiplier` from the plan.
`cargo test --workspace` 270 passed; UI nav-test 150/150, focus-check 100/100. Release build
`launcher/tools/build-release.ps1`: GT4Recomp.exe 16,040,448 bytes, sha256 `87c08add...`, path scan clean. A
`visual-check` build of the same code (scratchpad target dir) on a scratch data and Documents folder listed the real
monitor ("Legacy Moonli...", the Moonlight virtual display, 1920x1080 primary) and its modes (3840x2160 down to
640x480); Play was not pressed.

Owner test build (not a release): `private/release-110-test-out/GT4Recomp-Setup-ultrawide-test.exe`, 28,764,515 bytes,

equal to their sources). No GitHub release, draft or tag.

## Slice 240 - TASK-088 release 1.2.0: custom textures, 2-row crop, black start (`--mode pcsx2`)

slice240 = the slice218 recipe (same capsule, EE library, port, shaders, SDL3 and gt4-gs package layout) with one
host change: `native/window.cpp` gives the game window a black class background brush (it had none, so a new window
showed white until its first frame). Build: `private/slice240-game-scripts/build-game-240.bat <build dir> aspect`
(the slice218 script with the source worktree `C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-088-textures`), build dir
`private/slice240-game-build/build`. `gt4vulkan.exe` 97,221,120 bytes, sha256
`1623af1ef2c456457b9e87cd2c7d3d014a0d05761d1e30ae1077216ab4e5d700` (slice218: `e96f3549...`).

- Pin: `docs/inputs/slice240-pcsx2.json` (new file; `slice218-pcsx2.json` kept as history). `PERF_PROFILES['pcsx2']`
  points at slice240; `pcsx2-slice218` keeps the old entry. The gt4-gs package in the pin is still the slice203 1.0.1
  package (the dev run only; the owner's launcher uses its own gt4-gs, see below).
- CTest 38 of 39 passed on the first run (`python_native_contracts` ran the Python suite and failed on the pin
  and default-INI expectations, fixed in this branch); see the re-run line below.
- Python suite: `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD=C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice240-game-build\build`, pin tests point at
  slice240. New expectations: the default gt4-gs.ini has `LoadTextureReplacements = true` (always written, Load custom
  textures on); the gs table has 72 rows (`textures_folder` added); the Advanced page has 41 rows (`texture_precache`).
- Settings: schema 6 (`launcher\crates\gt4l-core\src\migrate.rs`, `settings_5_to_6`: no value changes; the schema 5
  file is backed up as before). The gs-table rows: `texture_load` (Graphics, default on, always written) and
  `texture_precache` (Advanced, default off, when set); `textures_folder` (launcher-supplied `[Folders] Textures`,
  `Documents\Gran Turismo 4\Textures`, created on play by `paths::ensure_texture_folders`). Command
  `open_textures_folder` (commands.list, capabilities/default.json, main.rs; UI button in the Graphics section).
- Launcher: `cargo test --workspace` green (new tests `launcher/crates/gt4l-core/tests/textures.rs`, the schema 5 to 6
  migration test, the gt4-gs 1.2.0 minimum). UI nav-test 150 of 150. focus-check 92 of 100 on this checkout and on the
  baseline copy of 6422988 (the same 8 tab-highlight checks fail on both in the browser pane; not caused by this change).
- Distribution `private/slice240-dist` (18 files): `python scripts\make_distribution.py private\slice240-dist ...
  --exe private\slice240-game-build\build\gt4vulkan.exe --runtime-manifest docs\inputs\slice240-pcsx2.json`;
  `gt4vulkan.exe --portable-check` `result: ok`.
- gt4-gs 1.2.0 (`gt4recomp-gs` branch `gt4gs/textures-1.2.0`, commit `c9dc54e93`): see `gt4gs/BUILD.md` "Release 1.2.0".
  Replay test `gt4gs/tests/test_textures_1_2.py` (log checks: the replacement folder without serial, zero replacements
  for a missing folder, refused Dump and CropBottom keys, the 2-row crop). Offline replays of this build end after VM
  initialization (exit -16843010, as in 1.1.0), so the frame comparison is skipped; the checks read the startup log.
  `gt4-gs.exe` 1.2.0 package: `private/slice240-gt4gs-120/gt4-gs-1.2.0-windows-x64.zip`, `check-nojit.ps1` passed.
- Owner install helper for the local gt4-gs 1.2.0 (not run by the agent): `private/slice240-gt4gs-120/install-gt4gs-1.2.0-test.ps1`.
  It checks the zip against `SHA256SUMS`, writes `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp\gs\1.2.0\` (with `sha256.txt`) and sets
  `current.txt` to 1.2.0; 1.1.0 stays as the fallback. A dry run in a scratch `LOCALAPPDATA` passed.

Limits (not checked here): the white start and the 2-row crop are visible only on the owner's screen (no window was
opened on the desktop; the checks are the build, the log and the code path). A texture pack's effect is not checked on
a real pack.

Launcher and owner test installer (2026-10-21): `launcher\tools\build-release.ps1` gives `GT4Recomp.exe` 16,028,160 bytes,
sha256 `d5d881278f768bdf8dddc5fac61ba3133069373ada38aed3abac97ea5c4fe272`, path scan clean. `makensis /DVERSION=1.2.0`
with `GAME_DIR` `private\slice240-dist` gives `private\slice240-installer\GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.0-test.exe`, 28,765,729 bytes,
sha256 `0edcfefe3a143c180bdc1255357780d414aac9cd1e60bf65fc6b583648187ec7`. The WebView2 bootstrapper is the one of
release 1.0.0 (`private\release-100-webview2`). Not published: no tag, release or draft.

Checks on the final tree: `cargo test --workspace` green; Python suite `unittest discover` with the slice240 build: 629 tests,
OK, 24 skipped (the same skips as before); CTest 39 tests (the Python suite runs inside `python_native_contracts`).

### Round 2 of release 1.2.0 (2026-10-21): monitors, desktop resolution, every gt4-gs value, GSdx choice

- Launcher `launcher\tools\build-release.ps1`: `GT4Recomp.exe` 16,078,336 bytes, sha256
  `49d25309ab5c804680842fc7a817375c14e701ef47e79f2897deed353b9a7121`, path scan clean.
- Owner test installer in a new folder: `private\slice243-installer\GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.0-test.exe`, 28,771,288 bytes,
  sha256 `92666e14386d92fa5098f69a0aab4ae452c1e8978e3329abfd606ed606f0e585` (game files `private\slice240-dist`, unchanged).
- gt4-gs is unchanged (zip `private\slice240-gt4gs-120\gt4-gs-1.2.0-windows-x64.zip`); the acceptance test
  `gt4gs/tests/test_enabled_values_1_2.py` accepts all 78 enabled values (12 rounds, VM initialization reached).
- Checks: `cargo test --workspace` green; Python suite (slice240 build) 629 tests OK, 24 skipped; UI nav-test 150 of 150;
  focus-check 92 of 100 (the same 8 pre-existing tab-highlight failures as the baseline).
- Merge of PR #72 (TASK-089, JulioHeroZ) with a merge commit on this branch.

## Slice 250 - TASK-091 release 1.2.1: per-machine install, data beside the program, user data in AppData

Launcher and installer only: the game executable, its pins and gt4-gs 1.2.0 are unchanged (game files
`private\slice240-dist`, as in 1.2.0). Branch `task/091-install-layout-121` from
main `ca0c262`. Owner decisions 2026-10-22 (TASKS.md TASK-091, release notes [1.2.1](release-notes/1.2.1.md)).

Path model (`launcher\crates\gt4l-core\src\paths.rs`):

| Item | 1.2.0 | 1.2.1 |
|---|---|---|
| Program files | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\GT4Recomp` (per user) | `C:\Program Files\GT4Recomp` (per machine, any folder) |
| Disc copy `disc\`, prepared files `prepared\` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` | `<exe dir>\data` |
| gt4-gs versions, `current.txt`, `cache\`, `data\` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp\gs` | `<exe dir>\data\gs` |
| Runtime card and lock `runtime\`, `sessions\`, `logs\` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` | `<exe dir>\data` (1.2.0 copies under `data\logs\from-1.2.0` when the new folder exists) |
| `version.json` | install folder | install folder (installer); `data\version.json` when the install folder is read-only |
| Custom textures | `Documents\Gran Turismo 4\Textures` | `<exe dir>\data\Textures` |
| `config\settings.toml` (+ backups), `library-migration.json` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp\config` | `%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp\config` |
| `controls.toml` (+ backups) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` | `%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp` |
| Save library `Saves\`, `Replays\` | `Documents\Gran Turismo 4` (fallback `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp\Gran Turismo 4`) | `%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp` |
| Card backups | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp\library\backups` | `%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp\backups` |
| Pre-1.0 library (`library\memcard`, ...) and its parked folders | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` | stays there (migrated into `%APPDATA%` by the existing rule) |

- The data folder is `<dir of GT4Recomp.exe>\data`, never a registry value or a stored absolute path. When it cannot be
  written (probe file), it becomes a read layer and writes go to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` (logged). The 1.2.0
  folder is a read layer too, so game files and gt4-gs that could not be moved stay in use.
- `settings.toml` stores a path inside the install folder relative to it (`disc_path`, `[dev] game_dir`); other paths
  (the disc image the player picked elsewhere) are kept as picked.
- Overrides for tests and development: `GT4RECOMP_DATA_DIR` (data folder; user folder `<it>\user`; no 1.2.0 folders),
  `GT4RECOMP_USER_DIR` (`%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp`), `GT4RECOMP_LOCAL_DIR` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp`),
  `GT4RECOMP_DOCUMENTS_DIR` (Documents). Under any of the first two the old-install cleanup is skipped.

Move from 1.2.0 (`launcher\crates\gt4l-core\src\relocate.rs`, driven by `gt4l-tauri\src\relocation.rs`): user data
before the window (copy to a staging folder, size and SHA-256 per file, place, marker
`%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp\config\migration-1.2.1.json`, then rename the old player folders to
`Gran Turismo 4 (moved to AppData)` with `README.txt`); large data on a background thread (rename on the same volume,
on `ERROR_NOT_SAME_DEVICE` a checked copy keeping modified times, the game files checked with `check_installed` and the
receipt and pinned disc SHA-256, then the source removed; marker `data\migration-1.2.1.json`; moved folders get
`icacls /reset` so they inherit the data folder's permissions). Not while `gt4vulkan.exe` or `gt4-gs.exe` runs. Play and
setup wait for the background move; the page shows a progress line and a result toast (`app_state().migration`).

Old per-user install (`launcher\crates\gt4l-platform\src\legacy_install.rs`): the launcher removes the 1.0.0-1.2.0
program files it can see (registry `InstallDir`, uninstall `InstallLocation`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\GT4Recomp`),
the per-user Start-menu shortcuts and `HKCU\Software\GT4Recomp` and the HKCU uninstall entry; never a folder holding
`data`, never the folder it runs from; registry only after the files are gone.

Self-update (`gt4l-platform\src\process.rs`): `release_kill_on_close` clears kill-on-close on the launcher job, then
`start_setup` uses `ShellExecuteExW` `runas` (UAC), with the breakaway start and the Explorer fallback behind it; a
declined prompt is final. 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 harness (`O:\gt4recomp-scratch\elevation-harness`, deleted after the run; a
copy of 1.2.0's start code in a kill-on-close job): `CreateProcess` with `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` of a
`requireAdministrator` exe and of the real 1.2.1 setup fails with `ERROR_ELEVATION_REQUIRED` (740); the fallback
`explorer.exe <program>` started a windowless stand-in that outlived the launcher's job (marker "survived"). The UAC
prompt itself was not shown on this PC (Hypothesis, high confidence: Explorer elevates a `requireAdministrator` setup).

Builds:

- Launcher: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice250-cargo-target` (C: had under 5 GB free) and
  `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File launcher\tools\build-release.ps1` (the script now honours
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and remaps and scans its path too). `GT4Recomp.exe` 16,299,520 bytes, sha256

  extraction: `GT4Recomp.exe` and `SDL3.dll` equal their sources, `game\` equal to `private\slice240-dist` (19 files,

## Slice 251 (review fixes) - TASK-091 release 1.2.1

Review fixes on slice 250 (all in `task/091-install-layout-121`):

- Launcher: `restore_kill_on_close` (`gt4l-platform`) sets kill-on-close again when the self-update's setup does not
  start (UAC declined, or every start fails); `start_launcher_setup` calls it and logs the result. Test:
  `job_breakaway.rs` "after_a_restore..." (a child in the job ends with the launcher).
- User-data move: every placement (free places and taken items) goes through `ops.rename`; a failed placement puts
  back what this run placed (or removes it), removes the staging folder and returns `Failed`, with no marker. Test:
  `relocate.rs` "a_failed_placement_puts_back...".
- Installer: `RemoveOldFolder` drops one trailing backslash before comparing with `$INSTDIR`.
- Checks: `cargo test --workspace` 332 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored (was 330; the two new tests).
- Launcher `GT4Recomp.exe` 16,304,128 bytes, sha256 `bd0a6f859c27f8c15bca9619cc08e1b64877be367c67d1e09e62f0d4390d5333`
  (`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice250-cargo-target`; copy in `private\slice251-launcher\GT4Recomp.exe`).
- Installer (same makensis recipe as slice 250, `/DVERSION=1.2.1`, output
  `private\slice251-installer\GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.1-test.exe`): 28,844,147 bytes, sha256
  `102753faf5bbdd77a25f35d224d0d6079f8d73100e1453389394f3bef4d320ab`. 7-Zip extraction: `GT4Recomp.exe` equals the
  new build, `SDL3.dll` equals its source; the extraction folder was deleted. Not run on this PC.

## Slice 252 - TASK-091 release 1.2.1: silent self-update, reinstall moves the data

Changes (branch `task/091-install-layout-121`):

- Launcher self-update (`gt4l-tauri` `updates.rs`, `setup_arguments`): when the running `GT4Recomp.exe` is in the
  registered install folder (HKLM `Software\GT4Recomp` `InstallDir`, 64-bit view; case-insensitive, one trailing
  backslash ignored), the setup starts with `/S /UPDATE /D=<folder of GT4Recomp.exe>`. Elsewhere (a portable copy,
  no registration) it starts with no arguments, interactively. The arguments reach `ShellExecuteExW` (`lpParameters`,
  `runas`) and the direct start (`raw_arg`, so `/D=` stays last and unquoted). The Explorer fallback cannot pass them:
  that update stays interactive and the log says so (`gt4l-platform` `process.rs`, `start_setup`).
- Installer (`installer/gt4recomp.nsi`): `/UPDATE` (FileFunc `GetOptions`) together with `${Silent}` starts the
  launcher as the player (Explorer) at the end of the install section. A reinstall into another folder: the previous
  program folder (HKLM `InstallDir`, when it is another folder and holds `GT4Recomp.exe`) loses `GT4Recomp.exe`,
  `SDL3.dll`, `NOTICE.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, `version.json`, `uninstall.exe` and `game\`, then a non-recursive `RMDir`
  (it stays while its `data` folder is there). Its `data` folder is never touched: HKLM `Software\GT4Recomp`
  `PreviousDataDir` = `<old folder>\data` is written when that folder exists. The old Start-menu shortcuts are
  rewritten by the install itself. All three `MessageBox` calls have `/SD IDOK`.
- Launcher, first start (`gt4l-platform` `install_record.rs` reads `PreviousDataDir`; `gt4l-core` `paths.rs` and
  `relocate.rs`; `gt4l-tauri` `relocation.rs`): the previous data folder is a read layer until its large data has
  moved, and a source of the large-data move, run after the 1.2.0 one. The move is the 1.2.0 move (units `game files`,
  `gt4-gs`, `runtime`, `sessions`, `logs`, `textures`; same volume a rename, another volume a checked copy, never while
  the game runs, a failure keeps the old place and retries). Its marker is per source folder:
  `<data>\migration-from-<key>.json`, the key being the first 8 bytes of the SHA-256 of the normalised old path
  (`DataDirs::previous_data_marker`). Logs, sessions and the runtime card that collide go to `logs\from-previous-install`.
  An old data folder left empty is removed afterwards (`relocate::remove_empty_folder`).
- Tests: `process.rs` (arguments reach both starts; Explorer logs that it cannot pass them; the command line stays one
  raw string), `updates.rs` (registered, portable and no registration), `paths.rs` (previous data is a read layer with
  its own marker; the test overrides keep it out), `gt4l-core\tests\relocate.rs` (same volume; another volume; the
  marker stops a second run; a missing folder is skipped; game files already in the install folder are kept and the
  old logs go beside them). 343 tests in all (was 332).

Builds (all paths absolute):

- Launcher: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice250-cargo-target`, `GT4_SDL3_ROOT` as in slice 250, and
  `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File launcher\tools\build-release.ps1`. `GT4Recomp.exe` 16,333,312 bytes,
  sha256 `0b8d004b2a99273b382c15a79c12554d761d384bbdca5f299f2357cbe5953a83`, at
  `O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice250-cargo-target\release\GT4Recomp.exe`.
- Installer: the slice 251 recipe with `/DLAUNCHER_EXE` pointing at that build, and
  `makensis` from `C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS`:
  `/DOUTFILE=C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp\private\slice252-installer\GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.1-test.exe`
  gives 28,845,242 bytes, sha256 `2FD43DCF6D18FDAE981AF0CD22D79E259E7175ED08DFF41AE3007802A1CF42FF`. 7-Zip
  extraction: `GT4Recomp.exe` equals the release build (extraction folder deleted). Not run on this PC.
- Checks: `cargo test --workspace` (from `launcher\`): 343 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored.

### Slice 253 (coordinator review fix)
- `PreviousDataDir` is taken only when the launcher runs from the registered install folder (HKLM `InstallDir`), so a
  portable copy on the same PC never moves the installed data (`relocation::previous_data_for`, test
  `only_the_registered_install_takes_the_previous_data_folder`). `cargo test --workspace`: 344 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored.
- Launcher `private\slice253-launcher\GT4Recomp.exe` 16,318,976 bytes, sha256
  `015f2ba390edff95ed4c007fc01069ca80988697dadfa66f809ac2c130cb0efe`, path scan clean.
- Installer (slice 252 recipe, `/DLAUNCHER_EXE` = that copy):
  `private\slice253-installer\GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.1-test.exe` 28,850,750 bytes, sha256
  `e67f29470ce4d882cd6aa3bd5606961ab09723243f9bcb6d12806e7327a6650f`. Not run on this PC.

### Slice 255 (safe updates)
- TASK-091 (1.2.1): the installer no longer overwrites a live install in place (`installer/gt4recomp.nsi`).
- Wait (`.onInit`): the fixed `Sleep 1500` is gone. For an existing install, the files it replaces (`GT4Recomp.exe`,
  `SDL3.dll`, `game\gt4vulkan.exe`, every `game\*.dll`) are waited for: up to 30 s, 60 checks 500 ms apart. A file is
  free when it does not exist or opens for writing (`FileOpen ... a`). Still locked, silent: `locked: <file>` is logged
  and the run aborts with error level 2, before anything is changed. Interactive: Retry/Cancel (`/SD IDCANCEL`); Retry
  waits again, Cancel aborts with error level 2.
- Staging: every program file is extracted into `$INSTDIR\.update-staging` first (the whole `game` folder included). A
  flagged extraction error or a missing key file (`GT4Recomp.exe`, `SDL3.dll`, `game\gt4vulkan.exe`) deletes the staging
  folder and aborts with error level 4; no live file is touched.
- Swap: each live item goes to `$INSTDIR\.update-old`, then its staged copy is renamed into place, in the order
  `GT4Recomp.exe`, `SDL3.dll`, `NOTICE.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, `game`. A failed rename rolls the items back (the previous copies
  return from `.update-old`, a new copy goes back to staging) and aborts with error level 3. On success `.update-old` and
  `.update-staging` are removed. A `.update-old` left by an interrupted run is rolled back first, before the new run.
- `data\` is never touched by the swap. The old per-user and previous-folder removal now runs after the swap, so a failed
  swap removes nothing from an earlier install. The uninstaller write, `version.json`, registry, shortcuts, `icacls`,
  EstimatedSize and the `/UPDATE` relaunch are unchanged.
- `data\logs\setup.log`: one line per run, `setup 1.2.1: mode <silent|interactive>, update flag <0|1>, result: <ok |
  locked: <file> | extract failed | swap failed at <item>, rolled back | swap failed at <item>, rollback failed at <item>>`.
  The command-line echo is gone.
- Error levels: 2 locked, 3 swap or rollback failed, 4 extract failed. Every MessageBox keeps a `/SD` default.
- Build: the slice 254 recipe with `/DLAUNCHER_EXE` = `private\slice253-launcher\GT4Recomp.exe` (launcher unchanged, no
  cargo run) and output `private\slice255-installer\GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.1-test.exe`: 28,848,063 bytes, sha256 `b982802e9b979a8a333f8f00fbeee752ce28afc760f4e601734442cfcce772d5`.
  7-Zip extraction: `.update-staging\GT4Recomp.exe`, `SDL3.dll`, `NOTICE.md`, `LICENSE.txt` and `game\gt4vulkan.exe` equal
  their sources; the extraction folder was deleted. Not run on this PC.
- Not verified: the installer has not been run (no locked-file, disk-full or rollback test). Known limits: `uninstall.exe`
  and `version.json` are still written in place after the swap (not rolled back); a read-only file in the install folder
  counts as locked for the full 30 s; if a rollback rename fails, the run reports `rollback failed at <item>` and the next
  run restores `.update-old` first.

### Slice 256 (coordinator review of slice 255)
- A marker `.update-swapping` exists only while a swap runs. The next run restores `.update-old` only when the marker
  is there (an interrupted swap); a leftover `.update-old` without it (a completed swap whose clean-up was blocked) is
  just removed, so a finished update is never reverted. The uninstaller also removes `.update-staging`,
  `.update-old` and the marker.
- Installer `private\slice256-installer\GT4Recomp-Setup-1.2.1-test.exe` 28849390 bytes, sha256
  `a0543753539ce45b236033e249579103b32c55443da691d2a0279af45b367317` (slice 255 recipe, launcher slice253). Not run on this PC.

### Slice 257 (WebView2 guard, issue #80)
- Blank white launcher window (GitHub issue #80, GTX 750 Ti, Windows 10). The window starts hidden
  (`tauri.conf.json` `visible: false`, `backgroundColor` = `--carbon` `#13161b`). The page calls `ui_ready` after the
  first frame (or after 250 ms when the window is hidden), and the backend shows the window. `ui_ready` is idempotent.
- Watchdog (`src/webview_guard.rs`, `start_watchdog`): 12 s for `ui_ready`. Not ready and safe mode off: the flag
  `%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp\webview-safe-mode` (date and reason) is written, a new launcher starts with `--webview-restart`
  outside the kill-on-close job, and this process exits. The restarted launcher claims the single-instance mutex for up
  to 10 s (every 250 ms) instead of focusing the old window (`gt4l_platform::process::claim_single_instance_retrying`).
- Safe mode at start (before the web view exists): `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS` gets `--disable-gpu` appended
  (not twice); the log says `WebView2 safe mode (GPU acceleration off)`. Not ready in safe mode: the window is hidden and a
  native Win32 message (`gt4l_platform::dialog`, `MessageBoxW`, no WebView2) offers Yes = WebView2 download page
  (`https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703`), No = log folder, Cancel = close. Then the launcher exits.
- WebView2 missing or failing to start (`tauri::Builder::run` returns an error): the same native message, worded for
  "missing or could not start".
- Startup log: `WebView2 runtime version: <tauri::webview_version(), or unknown>` and the safe mode line.
- Settings > Graphics > Advanced > **Launcher GPU acceleration** (`get_settings_table` appends the row; `set_setting`
  with id `launcher_gpu`): shown Off while the flag exists; On deletes the flag, Off writes it; takes effect at the next
  start.
- Test only: `GT4RECOMP_TEST_UI_NEVER_READY=1` makes `ui_ready` ignored, so the watchdog and the native message can be
  seen (the launcher then shows nothing for 12 s, restarts, and shows the message in safe mode). Not for players.
- Checks: `cargo test --workspace` (from `launcher\`) 351 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored (344 before; 7 new in
  `webview_guard`). UI nav-test 150 of 150; focus-check 100 of 100 (headless Edge through Playwright, `channel: msedge`;
  `scenario=advanced` only sets the state for a screenshot and writes no result).

  equals the launcher; the extraction folder was deleted. Not run on this PC.


### Slice 258 (WebView2 check at start, update restart speed; issue #80, release 1.2.1)
- WebView2 check before any window (`gt4l_platform::webview2`, `webview_guard::check_webview2_at_start`): the `pv` of
  client `{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}` is read as the installer does (HKLM WOW6432Node, HKLM, HKCU; empty or
  `0.0.0.0` is absent). A missing runtime shows the native message (`Problem::Missing`) at once, not after the 12 s
  watchdog. A fixed-version runtime (`WEBVIEW2_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_FOLDER` set) skips the registry check. The log gets
  `WebView2 runtime found in the registry: <pv>` or `not found`, next to the `tauri::webview_version` line.
- Test only: `GT4RECOMP_TEST_WEBVIEW2_MISSING=1` forces the absent result (the version is still logged). Not for players.
- Launcher start-up: `ui ready after N ms` (from process start, logged by `ui_ready`); `start-up: data layout and
  relocation ready after N ms`; `start-up: settings loaded in N ms`; `start-up: old install clean-up finished in N ms`
  (the clean-up now runs on a background thread after the window is created).
- Single instance: a second start brings the running window forward only when that window is shown
  (`gt4l_platform::process::should_bring_forward`); a hidden window (page not ready yet) is left to the first launcher.
- Installer 1.2.1 update path (`installer\gt4recomp.nsi`): setup.log gets phase timings in ms (`onInitWait`, `webview2`,
  `stage`, `swap`, `files`, `data`, `shortcuts_registry`, `estimated_size`, `relaunch_request`, and after the start
  `old_copies`, `old_user_install`, `previous_folder` in a second line). The data folder gets icacls only on a fresh
  install or when a write probe fails (an update keeps the grant). EstimatedSize sums `game` and the top-level files
  (`/G=0`), not the data tree. The launcher starts (silent `/UPDATE`) before the old copies and per-user leftovers are
  removed; the previous data folder is recorded before the start (the launcher moves it).
- Known limit: the write probe runs in the elevated setup, so it can pass while a player cannot write the data folder.
  The grant of a fresh install is unchanged.
- Checks: `cargo test --workspace` (from `launcher\`) 364 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored (351 before; 10 WebView2 unit tests
  and 3 single-instance tests). UI nav-test 150 of 150; focus-check `pass` (100 checks; headless Edge through Playwright,
  `channel: msedge`, run from a temporary script outside the repository).

  `/DLAUNCHER_EXE` = the copy above, `GAME_DIR` slice240-dist, SDL3 and WebView2 bootstrapper as before). 7-Zip extraction:
  `.update-staging\GT4Recomp.exe` equals the launcher; the extraction folder was deleted. Not run on this PC.
- Measured timings: the installer phases come from the owner's silent update (setup.log). `ui ready after N ms` comes
  from the owner's launch (not run here: no launcher window was opened on this PC).


### Slice 259 (1.2.1 final candidate: Performance Mode; slice 258 included)
- Performance Mode replaces the Readbacks row (`hw_download_mode`, five values) by a toggle `performance_mode` in
  `docs/launcher/gs-settings.toml` (page basic, Graphics; default Off). Off = `accurate` (HWDownloadMode 0, always
  written); On = `no-readbacks` (HWDownloadMode 2). The table validator (`scripts/gs_settings.py`, `check`) accepts a
  two-choice enum with `control = "toggle"`; the Rust table reads the same file. Launcher: `gs_row` (model.rs) sends a
  toggle, and with CoreGS 1.1 the row is disabled with the note "GSdx only" (GSDX_ONLY_ROWS). `set_setting` maps the
  toggle to the choice names (`gs_value_text`). The UI shows a row `note` as a hint.
- Settings schema 5 to 6 (`migrate.rs` settings_5_to_6, one step, schema 6 not released): a stored `hw_download_mode` other
  than accurate becomes `performance_mode = "no-readbacks"`; accurate or none stays Off; the old key is dropped. The backup
  (`settings.toml.bak-schema5-<time>`) is made as for every step.
- The allow-list JSON is generated from the table (`gs_settings.py allowlist --write`): HWDownloadMode values are now 0
  and 2 only. The golden fixture `user-settings.ini` gained `HWDownloadMode = 2` (regenerated with the script).
- Dev tooling: `--gs-readback accurate|no-readbacks` and `GT4_GS_READBACK` map to `performance_mode`; `unsynchronized` is refused
  (it left the table). `tests/python/test_gs_*` updated; the full Python suite passes (tooling venv).
- Checks: `cargo test --workspace` (from `launcher\`) 371 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored (364 before: +2 migration, +4 model,
  +1 golden). UI nav-test 150 of 150; focus-check `pass` (headless Edge through Playwright, `channel: msedge`).

  above). 7-Zip extraction: `.update-staging\GT4Recomp.exe` equals the launcher; the extraction folder was deleted.
  Not run on this PC.
- Measured: the launcher start timings (`ui ready after N ms`, phases before the window) and the installer phases
  (setup.log `timings ms:`) come from the owner's run. No launcher window was opened here.
## Slice 264 - TASK-092 (MTVU test switches, doorbell ordering)

Build recipe: the slice262 recipe with `-S C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-092-mtvu-switches` and `-B O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice264-build\build`
(C: is short of space). Every other `-D` value is the slice262 cache value (runtime capsule
`private/slice262-frame-cost-runtime`, guard `private/slice262-license-guard-runtime`, `GT4_EE_PROFILE=aspect`,
`GT4_RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=ON`). No new capsule and no new pin files in this slice.

Changes (`native/`): `vblank_journal_active(Settings)` in `mtvu_runtime.hpp` (`vblank_journal && enabled && !verify`) is
the one condition for `set_vsync_deferral` in `mtvu_bridge.cpp` and for `defer` in `vblank_sync()`; `mtvu_ring.hpp`
uses seq_cst on the doorbell handshake operations (`value_` fetch_add and load, `sleepers_` load and fetch_add in
`ring`/`wait_changed`; the statistics counters stay relaxed).

Checks:

- CTest: 40 of 41 pass. New `native_mtvu_switches` (`mtvu_switch_fixture.cpp`) passes: the 8-row truth table and the
  defaults. The failing test is `python_native_contracts`: `test_make_distribution` and `test_portable_install` check
  `gt4vulkan.exe` against the pin in `docs/inputs/slice262-pcsx2.json`, which the new executable differs from (pin
  `a0c7b5c0...`, slice264 `b9af2251...`). The same two tests pass on slice262 (Python 640 OK, 42 skipped, with
  `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice262), so they fail only through the executable change; a new pin set is an owner decision.
- Python with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice264: 638 of 640 pass with the two tests above failing.
- Headless identity (`scripts/frame_cost_headless.py`, 1x, `--env GT4_GS_STREAM_HASH=1`, default switches; hashes
  from `dumps.sha256`, the stream hash from the `[gs-ipc] session stream hash` line):

  | scene | build | dumps | dumps.sha256 (first 16) | GS stream hash |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | menus | slice262 | 41 | 463d455c3204cb56 | 1ccb97c58a6d2945 |
  | menus | slice264 | 41 | 463d455c3204cb56 | 1ccb97c58a6d2945 |
  | night | slice262 | 159 | c57e7d03aaccb3aa | c091716e3cb40d79 |
  | night | slice264 | 159 | c57e7d03aaccb3aa | c091716e3cb40d79 |

- Switches (menus, 4,200 frames): `GT4_MTVU=0` on slice264 exit 0, 41 dumps, 4,200 VSYNCs at the GS, stream hash
  1ccb97c58a6d2945 (same as the default path); on slice262 it exits 0xC0000005 (access violation) after about 1 s with
  no dumps (the before evidence). `GT4_MTVU_VERIFY=1` on slice264: `[mtvu] verify frames 4200 mismatches 0`, 41 dumps,
  4,200 VSYNCs, stream hash 1ccb97c58a6d2945.
- Run folders: `O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice264-runs\` (`menus-262`, `menus-264`, `mtvu0-264-menus`, `verify-264-menus`,
  `mtvu0-262-menus`, `night-262`, `night-264`). Not a perf benchmark.

## Slice 260/262 - TASK-084 frame cost, runtime side (`--mode pcsx2`)

Owner request 2026-10-21; study `docs/FRAME-COST-STUDY.md`. Item 1 of the study (deferred flare readback) is out by
owner decision: readback work belongs to CoreGS 2.0 (`decisions/gt4-gs-frozen`). This slice implements the study's
missing instrumentation (section 6) and items 2-4, each with a runtime A/B switch, and keeps the GS stream
byte-identical.

- **slice260** = the instrumentation + item 2 (one MTVU job per VIF1 DMA chain).
- **slice262** = the same plus item 4 (no second GS stream walk; worker output forwarded straight from the ring) and
  item 3 (VBlank as a journal entry in pcsx2 mode). slice262 is the release 1.2.2 candidate.

### What changed

Host code (`native/`):

- `perf_accounting.hpp`, `perf_probe.*`: categories `pacing_wait`, `run_due_events`, `kernel_service`, `guest_idle`,
  `syscall_dispatch` and `gif_walk`; a `[frame]` F8 section with GIF bytes/records per path, VIF1 packets/jobs/bytes,
  DMA chains, syscalls by number with their wall time, thread switches and the pacer's sleep; the study's fixed
  critical-path formula (frame wall minus pacing sleep) in `format_frame_summary` and in the GS-stream OSD.
- `window.cpp`: the pacer's sleep is its own scope, so `ee_dispatch`/`unattributed` mean work.
- `mtvu_ring.hpp`: one doorbell per direction with a sleeper count (a ring only notifies a peer that sleeps), ring
  statistics, and `try_peek`/`release` so the EE can forward a worker record without copying it.
- `mtvu_journal.*`: separate input/output bells; the producer waits for "worker progress", which also covers a worker
  blocked on a full output ring (the old single bell provided that wake-up by accident); worker records execute
  straight from the ring, and only chunked records are reassembled.
- `mtvu_runtime.*`: `VifBatch` chain jobs, `flush_vif_chain()` at the chain end, at a stall and before any journal or
  sync operation; `GT4_MTVU_CHAIN`, `GT4_GIF_FASTPATH`, `GT4_MTVU_VBLANK_JOURNAL`; the `[mtvu]` job-shape, doorbell
  and forwarded-bytes lines; `after_vblank_output()` moved to the drain when the VBlank is deferred.
- `mtvu_vif_batch.hpp`: the batch payload (packet count, then per packet `qwc` + `qwc*16` bytes) with the
  `native_mtvu_vif_batch` fixture.
- `gs_stream/gs_stream_client.*`: the client can hold the VSYNC (`set_vsync_deferral`, `post_pending_vsync`) so the
  journal can post it in stream order; the OSD critical path uses the same wall-minus-sleep formula.
- `mtvu_bridge.cpp`: in pcsx2 mode it installs the deferral and the callback that posts the held VSYNC.

Runtime capsule (`scripts/prepare_perf_runtime.py --mtvu --gs-stream --frame-cost`): run-loop scopes in `system.cpp`,
the VIF1 chain hooks in `dmac.cpp`, and the GS stream fast path plus its scope in `gif.cpp`. `--frame-cost` is opt-in,
so every earlier capsule still derives byte for byte (checked by `tests/python/test_frame_cost.py`).

License guard (`scripts/prepare_license_guard.py --display-aspect --frame-counters`): syscall and thread-switch
counters in `kernel.cpp`, on top of the halt dump.

### Switches (all on by default)

| variable | on | off (A/B) |
|---|---|---|
| `GT4_MTVU_CHAIN` | one job per VIF1 DMA chain, posted at the chain end, a stall, or before any journal/sync operation | one job per packet (pre-TASK-084) |
| `GT4_GIF_FASTPATH` | pcsx2 + MTVU: no second GS stream walk (PATH2/PATH3 signals were applied at accept) | walk every packet |
| `GT4_MTVU_VBLANK_JOURNAL` | pcsx2: the VSYNC is a journal entry after the frame's output; the EE does not drain at VBlank | blocking drain at VBlank |
| `GT4_PERF_COUNTERS` | the `[frame]` counters | counters off (zero overhead) |

### Build

```
private\slice260-scripts\build-game-260.bat <build dir> aspect <runtime capsule> <guard capsule>
```

which configures, in a VS x64 shell:

```

  -DGT4_LICENSE_GUARD_SOURCE=<assets>/private/<guard capsule> -DGT4_RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=ON
```

Pins:

- slice260: capsule `private/slice260-instrument-runtime` (`docs/inputs/slice260-instrument-runtime.json`), guard
  `private/slice260-license-guard-runtime` (`docs/inputs/slice260-license-guard-runtime.json`), launcher profile
  `docs/inputs/slice260-pcsx2.json`.
- slice262: capsule `private/slice262-frame-cost-runtime` (`docs/inputs/slice262-frame-cost-runtime.json`), guard
  `private/slice262-license-guard-runtime` (`docs/inputs/slice262-license-guard-runtime.json`), launcher profile
  `docs/inputs/slice262-pcsx2.json` (mode `pcsx2` while the owner tests it).

### Checks (slice262)

- CTest: 40 of 40 pass (new `native_mtvu_vif_batch`; `native_mtvu_ring` adds the doorbell policy and
  `try_peek`/`release`).
- Python: 639 tests OK, 42 skipped, with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice262 (the new `tests/python/test_frame_cost.py`
  adds 10).
- Frame identity against release 1.2.0 (slice240), same schedules and seed cards, headless 1x: menus 41/41 dumps,
  day race 15/15, night race 15/15; the GS stream session hash (`GT4_GS_STREAM_HASH=1`) is identical in all three
  scenes. The dumps come from the GS process (`DumpEvery`), because in pcsx2 mode the game process has no framebuffer.
- `GT4_MTVU_VERIFY=1`: 4,200 frames, 0 shadow/worker mismatches (the verify path keeps the blocking drain because it
  compares both VIF1 states while idle).
- Headless harness: `scripts/frame_cost_headless.py` (scenes, gt4-gs.ini, hashes, conditions, builder check).
- Distribution `private/slice262-dist` (18 files) from `scripts/make_distribution.py` with
  `--runtime-manifest docs/inputs/slice262-pcsx2.json`: `gt4vulkan.exe --portable-check` prints `result: ok`
  (9 of 9 shaders, release build without a build-time shader fallback, no GS process in the folder).

### Headless numbers, before and after each step

One build (slice262), four configurations, `GT4_MTVU_REPORT_EVERY=500`, 1x, no dumps, no stream hash, on this PC
(Ryzen 7 5700X). `base` = all three switches off (pre-TASK-084); `s1` = `GT4_MTVU_CHAIN=1`; `s2` = plus
`GT4_GIF_FASTPATH=1`; `s3` = plus `GT4_MTVU_VBLANK_JOURNAL=1` (the defaults). Averages of the steady intervals:
menus i=0-7 (VBlanks 0-4,000), day race i=19-31 (VBlanks 9,500-16,000), night race i=18-25 (flare readbacks on),
showroom i=12-13 (the car showroom inside the day-race schedule). All times ms per VBlank.

Summary (frame wall, ms per VBlank; the deltas are against `base`, same build and schedule):

| scene | base | +item 2 (chain jobs) | +item 4 (GIF fast path) | +item 3 (VBlank journal) | total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| menus | 1.54 | 1.41 | 1.38 | 1.41 | **-0.13** |
| day race | 12.07 | 11.01 | 11.07 | 10.38 | **-1.69** |
| night race (flare readback) | 13.21 | 11.84 | 11.95 | 12.08 | **-1.13** |
| showroom | 9.88 | 9.36 | 9.14 | 8.61 | **-1.27** |

Reading: item 2 does most of the work (day race EE CPU 10.3 -> 9.3 ms, `vif_gif` 1.32 -> 0.89, doorbell rings 11283 -> 349 per frame, jobs 5555 -> 88); item 4 removes the second GS
stream walk and its copy; item 3 removes the VBlank wait in the scenes that had one (day race `wait vblank` 3.43 -> 0.00, showroom 4.44 -> 0.00), while the night race keeps its
flare-readback `download` wait (4.97 ms) because item 1 is out of scope. The night `EE wait` falls from 6.02 to 4.97 ms because the
chain jobs leave less to drain per download. VU1 worker busy is unchanged (8.50 -> 8.03 ms day), so after these items the worker is
the critical path of the day race.

### Owner F7/F8 check (paced, windowed)

From the repository root (PowerShell), with the release candidate build (mode `pcsx2` = slice262):

```
private\tooling-venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\play_performance.py --assets-root C:\Antigravity\gt4-staticrecomp --mode pcsx2
```

Mode pcsx2 reads the pinned slice262 profile. Check one scene per F7/F8 interval (F7 when the scene has settled, F8 after about
30 s):

1. **Time Trial, Nordschleife, Toyota Supra Wood One, in-game video 480p** (the reference scene).
2. **Night race** (Arcade -> Single Race -> City Courses -> Clubman Stage Route 5, 5 AI).
3. **Showroom or garage** (the car rotating).

Report lines to compare with the tables above (same scene, this build):

- `[perf] frame ms: median ... p99 ...` - the frame time; should not be worse than 1.2.0 in the same scene.
- `[frame] ... critical path ...` - the EE frame minus the pacer's sleep (the study's formula).
- `[mtvu] vif jobs/frame ... doorbells/frame ...` - jobs per frame and wake-ups; the doorbell rings should be in the
  hundreds, not the thousands.
- `[mtvu] EE wait ms/frame: vblank=...` - at VBlank it should be near zero in pcsx2 mode (`vblank_deferred` in the
  `[mtvu] sync` lines); the night race keeps its flare-readback `download` wait (item 1 is out of scope).
- `[mtvu] worker ms/frame: vu1_program=... busy=...` - the VU1 worker; it is now the critical path of the day race.

A/B in the same scene, if wanted: `$env:GT4_MTVU_CHAIN="0"`, `$env:GT4_GIF_FASTPATH="0"` or
`$env:GT4_MTVU_VBLANK_JOURNAL="0"` before the launch (the probe records them in `result.json`).

### Limits

- The measurements come from a machine that also ran other agents' work; the A/B deltas within one matrix are the
  usable result, not the absolute values (the study's slice211 baseline was 8.2 ms day / 9.9 ms night with the same
  1x gt4-gs and no probe).
- In pcsx2 mode the `[gif] path 2/3 tags` session counters stay zero with the fast path on: the walk that filled them
  is exactly what the fast path removes. They are diagnostics only; nothing reads them.
- The last VSYNC before shutdown can be posted after the GS process's session summary (it is harmless: the window is
  closing). Frame dumps and the session hash of full runs are unaffected.
- The mode-3 (interlaced) and 3x cases are not re-measured here; the switches do not depend on the resolution.

## Spec II S3 - target-aware host hooks (TASK-100, v2.00 byte-identical)

Second target: [decision 0072](decisions/0072-spec2-second-target.md), plan [SPEC2-PLAN](SPEC2-PLAN.md). This slice
changes only the host side of v2.00.

### What changed

- `native/game_target.hpp`: one per-target table. `HookAddresses` carries every guest address or offset that a host
  hook touches: the TASK-079 16:9 hold (owner pointer, option/flag/record offsets, video system, presets, published
  word), the TASK-080 race display 480p (index offset and its three values), the TASK-080 display aspect (initMonitor,
  the camera call return label, RaceDisplay::render, the display request state and offsets, HUD matrix offset, HUD
  parameter block) and the TASK-017 license guard (both loader entries and their return labels, loadDemoInputs, the
  CRC table). `kV200Hooks` holds the qualified release values; `kSpec2Hooks` is empty, so every hook disables itself
  and logs one line. `GT4_TARGET=v200|spec2` selects at build time (`GT4_TARGET_SPEC2`); the default is v200.
- The four hook modules read their constants from the table instead of keeping private copies
  (`race_widescreen.*`, `race_display.*`, `display_aspect.hpp`, `license_guard.hpp`). The public constant names stay,
  so fixtures and the overlay capsules compile unchanged: `kCameraCallReturn` and `kRaceDisplayRender` become
  `0xFFFFFFFF` ("never matches") when the target has no hook, which keeps the capsule text byte-identical.
- Availability gates: `force_widescreen_at_vblank`, `force_race_480p_at_vblank`, `HudCanvasHook::apply`,
  `write_hud_parameters` and the display request read return early (and log once) when the active target lacks the
  hook. `license_guard::loader_for_return` returns 0, so the capsule never enters the guard.
- HUD parameter block `0x7F00` stays a literal: it is our own scratch block in guest kernel RAM, not a game address,
  and two `static_assert`s tie it to the v2.00 table entry.
- New fixture `native/game_target_fixture.cpp` plus `native/game_target_spec2_fixture.cpp` (compiles the same header
  with `GT4_TARGET_SPEC2`), CTest `native_game_target`.

### Build (v2.00, slice262 recipe with the release capsules)

```
cmake -S C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-100-spec2 -B O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s3-build\build -G Ninja ^

  ... (the rest of the slice262 recipe) ... -DGT4_RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=ON
```

### Checks

- CTest 42 of 42 (`native_game_target` is new).
- Python suite with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = this build: 653 OK, 42 skipped, 1 failure:
  `test_make_distribution` compares `gt4vulkan.exe` against the **release** slice268 pin, so any rebuilt executable
  fails it (same size, different hash). A new pin set is a release decision, exactly as recorded for slice264.
- The Spec II half of the fixture proves an empty table disables every hook; the v2.00 half checks every documented
  value, so the release behaviour cannot drift silently.
- Headless frame identity against slice268 (menus, day, night; `GT4_GS_STREAM_HASH=1`): results in the Progress
  section of SPEC2-PLAN.

## Spec II S4 - second target build (TASK-100)

The target is a separate build that never replaces v2.00:

- `-DGT4_TARGET=spec2` (compile-time `GT4_TARGET_SPEC2`, empty hook table) and `-DGT4_EE_PROFILE=spec2` (the Spec II
  library, pinned by `docs/inputs/spec2-ee-libraries.json`). CMake refuses a mismatched pair.
- The output is `gt4vulkan-spec2.exe`; `gt4vulkan.exe` and its pins are untouched.
- The perf runtime capsule accepts the `spec2` profile (target-independent code); the license guard capsule is the
  slice277 one (S8b).

Library (S8c reseed): `private/slice278-spec2-ee-producer/game-build/ps2game.lib`, 80,229,124 bytes, sha256 `9a94c3ed…`, built from
the 346 units in `O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s8c-generated-clean` with clang-cl 23.1.2:

```
cmake -S tools/ee_producer -B O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s8c-lib-build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<assets>/private/tooling/llvm-23.1.2/bin/clang-cl.exe ^
  -DGT4_DONOR=<assets>/private/references/ps2-web-recomp -DGT4_PYTHON=<assets>/private/tooling-venv/Scripts/python.exe ^
  -DGT4_GENERATED=O:/gt4recomp-scratch/spec2-s8c-generated-clean -DGT4_BUILD_TRANSLATOR=OFF
cmake --build O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s8c-lib-build --target ps2game --parallel 4
```

Executable recipe (worktree needs `-DGT4_PYTHON`): the slice262 capsule recipe with
`-DGT4_EE_PROFILE=spec2 -DGT4_TARGET=spec2`, build dir `O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s4-build`.

The units come from `scripts/spec2_ee_generate.py --entries private/slice278-spec2-ee-producer/entry-seeds.txt`; the
seed file is produced by `scripts/spec2_entry_seeds.py --generated <previous units>` (wide `luipair` window 64,
stack-frame fallthrough, executable-segment literal code entries). `native/CMakeLists.txt` accepts only the slice278
library for the spec2 profile; `spec2-s4-generated` and slice274 stay as history.

### S7b findings (blocked before the menus)

- **Program-header overlap**: the plugin PT_LOAD sits inside the data PT_LOAD's address range. The runtime loads in
  order (plugin wins); the translator reads the first containing segment (zeros). `scripts/spec2_elf_patch.py` splits
  the data segment around the plugin, which keeps the loaded image identical and makes the lookup unambiguous.
- **Plugin tables are inside the executable segment**, so the translator's `dataword` source cannot see the plugin's
  own function pointers: 12 explicit entry seeds were needed (the five hook targets, the thunk, `0x68C7C4`,
  `0x68C6E8`).
- After both: 4,200 headless frames, **no "no translated code"**.
- Open: the game draws nothing after the display init (8 primitives against v2.00's 2,524 at the same frame); all EE
  threads wait and the IOP is idle. The original unpatched image behaves identically, so the stall is not from the
  patch set. The game requests the IOP reboot with `DNAS310.IMG` (the beta's protected runtime) instead of
  `IOPRP300.IMG`; the runtime only logs it. Next: semaphore trace, DNAS reboot overlay, IOP module A/B.

## Spec II S7b - the IOP reboot image and the FILEIO protocol (TASK-100)

The 2026-10-22 stall is fixed by one derived runtime source. The game reboots the IOP with
`rom0:UDNL cdrom0:\DNAS310.IMG;1`; the runtime never loads either reboot image (IOPRP300.IMG included), it serves the
16 system modules as native HLE. What the image selects is the **FILEIO protocol generation** through its own
LOADFILE version (`PsIIloadfile` tag: IOPRP300 `3000`, DNAS310 `3100`). The asynchronous server 0x80000001 answers a
`devctl` (method 23) with the SIF packet `0x80000011`; the synchronous fallback only sends the ordinary RPC end packet,
so the game's fileio thread waits forever on its completion semaphore.

Capsule (fresh `private/` child, never overwritten):

```
private/tooling-venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/prepare_perf_runtime.py <assets>/private/slice276-spec2-iop-runtime ^
  --assets-root <assets> --mtvu --gs-stream --frame-cost --vu0-aot --spec2-iop
private/tooling-venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/pin_frame_cost_runtime.py slice276-spec2-iop-runtime ^
  --assets-root <assets>
```

- `scripts/spec2_iop_overlay.inc` + `native/spec2_iop.hpp`: a `DNAS310.IMG` (or `IOPRP*`) reboot selects the
  asynchronous FILEIO server and logs the LOADFILE version. The derived `sif.cpp` is compiled from the capsule with
  `runtime/src`-relative includes (`iop/sif.hpp`, `hw.hpp`). The first attempt (`private/slice275-spec2-iop-runtime`)
  did not compile: its include block resolved `hw.hpp` to the IOP header; slice276 is the qualified capsule.
- CMake: `GT4_FRAME_CAPSULE_RE` covers `slice260`..`slice279`; a `slice27x` capsule also carries `sif.cpp`; the pin is
  `docs/inputs/<capsule name>.json`. A Spec II build also compiles `gt4_quickfix_v200_fixture` (the three hook modules
  with `GT4_TARGET_FIXTURE_V200`) so the v2.00 hook fixtures still run against the v2.00 table.
- CTest `native_spec2_iop` covers the reboot-image rule; `Spec2RuntimeCapsuleTests` and `IopRebootImageTests` in
  `tests/python/test_spec2.py` cover the overlay derivation and the `inputs/spec2-dnas310.json` pin.

Recipe (same as S4, with the new capsule), `O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s7d-build`:

```
cmake -S <worktree> -B O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s7d-build\build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^

```

Run notes:

- Configure **outside** a VS developer shell. Inside one, CMake picks the `cmake_llvm_rc` wrapper for the game .rc and
  that wrapper fails here (silent exit 1); the plain environment uses the native RC rule. Builds still need
  `PATH` with the LLVM bin folder.
- Headless review runs (donor renderer writes PPM frames; create the frame folder first):
  `gt4vulkan-spec2.exe <derived ELF> --ntsc --disc "<Spec II ISO>" --frames N --memcard <copy>.ps2 --misses misses.txt
  --frames-dir <dir> --frame-every 200 --press <frame>:<button>:<frames> ...`
- Boot press schedule found by hand (Spec II 1.10, seed card without GT data): `600:start`, `900:cross` (language),
  `1500:left`,`1600:cross` (decline game data), `2200:right`,`2300:cross` (start game), `6200:start` (skip intro),
  `8000:start` (main menu) → `9200:cross` (Arcade), `10000:cross` (Single Race), `11000/11200:down`, `11400:cross`
  (City Courses), `12200:cross` (track), `13000:cross` (Normal), `14400:cross` (Ford), carousel `right` ×5,
  `16400:cross` (car), `17200/18000:cross`, then hold `cross` to drive.
  A night race at C.S. Route 5: `10600:down` (City Courses), `10800:cross`, `right` ×9 (11200…12800), `13000:cross`
  (track), `13800:cross` (Normal), `14400:cross`, `15000:cross`, `right` ×5 (15600…16400), `17000/17800/18600:cross`,
  `19400:cross:2600` (accelerate).

## Spec II S7c - the shipping renderer (TASK-100)

The Spec II target on the external PCSX2 GS process (`GT4_RENDERER=pcsx2`), which is the shipping renderer until
CoreGS 2.0. Same launch path as the v2.00 pcsx2 mode, now with target overrides in
`scripts/frame_cost_headless.py` (defaults are the v2.00 gate values):

```
private/tooling-venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/frame_cost_headless.py ^
  --assets-root <assets> --build <spec2 build> --exe gt4vulkan-spec2.exe --scene menus --frames 21000 ^
  --elf <assets>/private/slice272-spec2-elf/SCUS_974.36 --iso "<Spec II ISO>" ^
  --press 600:start:30 ... --keep-dumps
```

- `--exe` picks `gt4vulkan-spec2.exe`; `--elf`/`--iso` replace the v2.00 inputs; `--press` replaces the scene schedule
  (repeatable, `FRAME:BUTTON:FRAMES`); `--gs-exe`/`--gs-sha256` choose the GS process and forward
  `GT4_GS_PROCESS_SHA256`; `--textures <dir>` writes `[Folders] Textures` **and**
  `[EmuCore/GS] LoadTextureReplacements = true` (PCSX2's loader switch defaults to off, the launcher always writes
  both) and `--scale` is the gt4-gs multiplier.
- Frame dumps come from the GS process (`DumpEvery`, `gs-frames/live_frameNNNNN.png`); the game process writes the
  conditions, including `gs_exe_sha256` and `textures`.
- The repo's pinned GS package is `private/slice203-gt4gs-release-pkg` (gt4-gs 1.0.1). Texture packs need gt4-gs
  1.2.1 or later, so the texture check uses the launcher's installed 1.2.1 (`<install>\data\gs\1.2.1\gt4-gs.exe`) and
  records its SHA-256; a release that ships packs must pin 1.2.1+.
- The GT4 display crop is a fixed constant in gt4-gs (`GT4_DISPLAY_CROP = {0,0,1,2}`, `pcsx2-gt4gs/Main.cpp`; the
  `[EmuCore/GS] Crop*` keys are refused) and applies to every live stream; the GS stderr logs
  `gt4-gs: display crop left 0 top 0 right 1 bottom 2 (native pixels)`. The game announces `SCUS-97328` in the
  handshake even for Spec II (`native/gs_stream/gs_stream_client.cpp`, `kGameSerial`), so gt4-gs selects the GT4
  GameDB entry; gt4-gs has no SCUS-97436 entry (recorded for S8/S9).

## Spec II S8 - host hooks for the Spec II image (TASK-100)

The Spec II table in `native/game_target.hpp` is filled for the 16:9 hold, the 480p race display hold, the race
camera aspect and the HUD canvas. The full address table and how each value was found are in the S8 Progress entry of
[SPEC2-PLAN](SPEC2-PLAN.md); the short version:

- option chain: owner word `0x664EDC`, option `owner + 0x680`, wide flag `+0x14`, record `+0x24` (44 bytes, width
  `+0xC`, height `+0x10`), presets `0x664E20/50/80/B0`, published wide word `0x6655A0`, race display index `+0x1718`;
- code: `RaceBase::initMonitor` `0x26BDB0` with camera return `0x26BE60`, `RaceDisplay::render` `0x1C5040` with the HUD
  matrix at `this + 0x70`;
- not mapped yet (rows stay 0 and the hook logs once): the display request struct (scene policy knows render activity,
  not photo mode), the shape observer. The license demo guard is mapped in S8b below.

The aspect overlay lives in the license guard capsule, so the Spec II build needs it. From S8b that capsule is
`slice277-license-guard-runtime` (the same profile as slice262 plus the per-target license guard):

```
cmake -S <worktree> -B O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s7d-build\build ... ^
  -DGT4_LICENSE_GUARD_SOURCE=<assets>/private/slice277-license-guard-runtime
```

Checks:

- `native_spec2_hooks` (`native/spec2_hooks_fixture.cpp`, always built with `GT4_TARGET_SPEC2`) asserts every table
  value and the write rules in synthetic 32 MiB RAM: the wide record is copied from `0x664E50`, the flag and
  `0x6655A0` are set, the 480p hold writes 1 on the normal index and keeps 1080i.
- Headless GSdx race (21,000 frames, Costa di Amalfi) at `GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT=21:9`: the log shows the camera matrix
  scaled (`x 0.761905`), `first RaceDisplay::render`, the HUD canvas (`left -240 right 880`) and the fill policy. The
  16:9 hold logs the settled owner `0x009BD690`; it writes nothing because the game itself boots 16:9. The 480p hold
  lives in `window.cpp`'s VBlank and is therefore not exercised by headless runs (fixture only).

## Spec II S8b - license demo guard (TASK-100)

The TASK-017 guard is on for Spec II. Table values (all in `native/game_target.hpp`; evidence in the S8b Progress
entry of [SPEC2-PLAN](SPEC2-PLAN.md)):

- `RaceSolitaire::loadDemoInputs` `0x2012C8` (vtbl `0x6B3130 + 0x510`), loaders `0x10CA18`/`0x10CBA8` with return
  labels `0x10CB54`/`0x10CCE4` (vtbl `+0x510` and `+0x1C8`), `Manager::load` `0x207AA0`, game CRC-32 table `0x731DB0`;
- `license_manager_add` `0x1A24` (the add inside `loadDemoInputs`) and `license_body_shift` `0x80` (the loader hands
  the virtual a pointer 0x80 into the body; the decrypted demos keep the Manager stream at body `+0x1AA4` on all
  discs). The overlay evaluates the CRC/layout at the header's body start and writes `n = 0xFFFFFFFF` at
  `a1 + manager_add`, exactly where the virtual reads; a static assert keeps `add + shift == 0x1AA4`.

The overlay text changed, so the guard capsule was re-derived (the slice262 profile, `--display-aspect
--frame-counters`) and pinned:

```
private/tooling-venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/prepare_license_guard.py ^
  <assets>/private/slice277-license-guard-runtime --assets-root <assets> --display-aspect --frame-counters
private/tooling-venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/pin_frame_cost_guard.py slice277-license-guard-runtime --assets-root <assets>
```

`native/CMakeLists.txt` accepts a slice26x or slice27x guard capsule (`docs/inputs/<capsule>.json`); the Spec II
build uses slice277, v2.00 keeps slice262.

Checks: `native_license_guard` (v2.00 rule), the extended `native_spec2_hooks` (Spec II values, both loader labels
key the guard and other labels do not, the shift/add maths, the rule), and the Python overlay harness compiled twice
(v2.00 and `GT4_TARGET_SPEC2` with a shifted pointer). Oracle on the 256 Spec II demos with our FPU: 0 CRC passes,
114 sane layouts, 142 demos guarded. A headless license demo is not reachable (GT mode needs game data), so the owner
run remains the gate.

## Spec II S8c - the Options-menu halt and the entry seeds (TASK-100)

Owner test 1 halted on opening Options at `0x003CA690` (ra `0x0050D1B0`). Root cause: the callback is built by
`lui s0,0x003D` at `0x003CC8EC` + `addiu s0,s0,-22896` at `0x003CC9C0` (53 instructions apart), so the translator's
3-instruction `luipair` window missed it. `scripts/spec2_entry_seeds.py` now emits the missing classes (wide `luipair`
window 64, stack-frame fallthrough, executable-segment literal code entries); 1,299 seeds produced 1,332,727
instructions / 18,597 functions / 153,474 entries, library `private/slice278-spec2-ee-producer/game-build/ps2game.lib`
(80,229,124 bytes, `9a94c3ed.`). The seed file stays in the slice (`entry-seeds.txt`, `041c1864.`); pins are
`docs/inputs/spec2-ee-libraries.json` and `docs/inputs/spec2-ee-generated.json`. CMake accepts only the slice278
library for the spec2 profile.

Headless: the old exe halts at `0x003CA690` after 11,159 frames on the same schedule; the new exe opens Options (and
all its submenus, Replay Theater, Save Game, Credits, GT Mode and the Arcade menu) with no halt. The new executable is
`O:\gt4recomp-scratch\spec2-s7d-build\build\gt4vulkan-spec2.exe`, 104,475,136 bytes, sha256 `301bbb4a.`. The harness
has `--card` for an owner-card copy; a license demo was still not reached headless.

## Release 1.3.0 (candidate, not published)

Merges on `task/101-multi-game`: `origin/main` `db5c559` (`63c110e`) and `origin/task/100-spec2` `9206af5` (`b8a6b5f`).
Version 1.3.0 in `launcher/Cargo.toml`, the workspace crates of `launcher/Cargo.lock`, `tauri.conf.json` and the
installer default. Release notes: `docs/release-notes/1.3.0.md` (full), `launcher/1.3.0.md` and

  -DGT4_EE_PROFILE=spec2`, perf runtime `slice276-spec2-iop-runtime`, license guard `slice277-license-guard-runtime`,
  EE library `slice278` (`docs/inputs/spec2-ee-libraries.json`), port/shaders/VU1/VU0 as v2.00,
  `GT4_RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=ON`.
- Pins: `scripts/pin_release_130.py <slice> --target gt4|spec2 --exe <path>` (new pin file, never edited; gs package
  1.2.1 in `private/slice281-gt4gs-121`). `PERF_PROFILES['pcsx2']` -> slice279; slice268 stays as `pcsx2-slice268`;
  `external_runtime_probe.SPEC2_RELEASE` holds slice280.
- `scripts/make_distribution.py` gained `--second-exe/--second-runtime-manifest`, so one GAME_DIR carries both exes.

## Slice 278 - TASK-097 self-sufficient game, TASK-098 portable build (release 1.3.0)

Build recipe: the slice268 / release 1.2.3 recipe (capsules `slice262-frame-cost-runtime`, `slice262-license-guard-runtime`,
port `slice200`, shaders `slice153-pacing-shaders`, `GT4_EE_PROFILE=aspect`, `GT4_RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION=ON`) with
`-S C:\Antigravity\gt4-wt-101-multi-game` and `-B O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice278-build\build` (C: is short of space). No new
capsule, no new pin file: the executable differs from every pinned one, so `test_make_distribution` (the release-pin check
of `docs/inputs/slice268-pcsx2.json`) fails with this build, as with any rebuilt executable.

Game side (`native/`):

- `game_main.cpp` is the new `main`. The pinned donor `main.cpp` (port slice200, hash-checked, untouched) is compiled with the
  source property `COMPILE_DEFINITIONS main=gt4_donor_main` and called from it. `bcrypt` is linked for the GSdx hash.
- `standalone.hpp/.cpp`: the rules, with injected file and environment access. A start with no ELF argument (argc 1, or only
  `--` options other than `--portable-check`) is *standalone*; an ELF argument is the *explicit mode*, which goes straight to the
  donor main as before (launcher, harnesses, pins). Standalone finds `<install>\game\gt4vulkan*.exe` -> `<install>\data\games\<id>`
  (fallback `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp`), checks the receipt like the launcher's `check_installed` (ELF size, disc copy size and
  modified time), reads `gs\current.txt` and the recorded `sha256.txt` of gt4-gs.exe, takes the launcher's `launcher.lock`,
  creates `data\sessions\standalone-<unix seconds>` (working directory, `game.log`, newest 20 kept), reads `game.ini` and
  `gt4-gs.ini` from `<install>\user\config` (if `<install>\user` exists) or `%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp\config`, and builds the old
  command line and environment. Order: argument or variable > `game.ini` > built-in default (GSdx, 480p, 16:9 hold, automatic
  ultrawide, fullscreen, vsync). A missing piece shows a native message (exit 3); `GT4_STANDALONE_MESSAGE_FILE=<file>` writes the
  text there instead (headless tests). `--no-window` (standalone only) leaves the window flag out.
- CTest `native_standalone` (`standalone_fixture.cpp`, samples in `native/standalone_samples/`); the sample `game.ini` is also
  compared with the launcher's output by `launch_contract.rs`.
- Python: `tests/python/test_standalone_start.py` (7 tests: not installed, no prepared files, no GSdx, changed disc copy,
  changed renderer, the explicit mode and `--portable-check` still reach the donor main).

Checks (CTest 43 of 44 pass; the failing one is `python_native_contracts`, whose only error is the release-pin test above;
Python with `GT4_NATIVE_BUILD` = slice278: 682 tests, 1 error, 42 skipped):

| scene | build | dumps | dumps.sha256 (first 16) | GS stream hash |

| menus | slice268 | 41 | 463d455c3204cb56 | 1ccb97c58a6d2945 |

Run with `scripts/frame_cost_headless.py ... --env GT4_GS_STREAM_HASH=1` (explicit arguments, 1x), run folders
`O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice278-runs\`. The per-dump lists (names and hashes) are byte-identical. A *standalone* headless start
(a scratch install with `game\`, `user\config`, `data\games\gt4`, `data\gs\1.0.0`; `gt4vulkan.exe --no-window --frames N --disc
<iso>` plus the scene's `--press` list, no ELF argument) gives the same results: menus `463d455c3204cb56` / `1ccb97c58a6d2945`,
day `992f1ac9a6871901` / `0c79dcf5208e5e4d`, and a harness run with the defaults set as explicit variables (`GT4_FORCE_480P=1
GT4_DISPLAY_ASPECT=auto GT4_FULLSCREEN=1 GT4_PRESENT_MODE=fifo`) has the same day dumps (`O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice278-standalone-*`).
The window, fullscreen, the message boxes and a double click were not run (no game window opens in this slice).

Launcher side (`launcher/`): `launch::standalone_config_text`, `AppState::write_standalone_files` (at start, after every
settings change, before every Play), tests in `launch_contract.rs` and `flow_audit.rs`; portable build: see TASKS.md TASK-098.
Cargo: `cargo test --workspace` with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=O:\gt4recomp-scratch\slice278-cargo-target` and `GT4_SDL3_ROOT`, in both builds
(`--features portable`).

## Distribution names (TASK-108, release 1.3.0)

The build output keeps its names: `gt4vulkan.exe` and `gt4vulkan-spec2.exe` in the build directory, and the developer
scripts (`play_performance.py`, `external_runtime_probe.py`, the harnesses) run them under those names.
`scripts/make_distribution.py` copies them into the game folder as `gt4.exe` and `gt4-spec2.exe`, checking the same
pins by hash, so the files are byte-identical and no pin changes. The installer (`installer/gt4recomp.nsi`) and the
portable zip (`scripts/make_portable_zip.py`) ship the new names; the installer deletes the 1.2.x names
(`game\gt4vulkan.exe`, `game\gt4vulkan-spec2.exe`) on install and update. The launcher starts `gt4.exe` and
`gt4-spec2.exe` and detects both old and new names as running games.
