// TASK-011 step 2: VU1 worker thread (MTVU) runtime, used by the slice170 capsule (docs/MTVU-PLAN.md section 11).
//
// Threads: the EE thread (emulation, shadow VIF1, GS front end, journal) and one VU1 worker. The EE posts each
// VIF1 packet, VIF1 register write and VU1 reset as a job with a journal placeholder; the worker runs the donor
// VIF1 parser and the VU1 programs on its own state and emits PATH1/PATH2 GIF bytes in order; the EE drains the
// journal and executes every GS operation (rendering) in serial order.
//
// Only the EE thread calls the EE entry points; the worker calls worker_gif() and the Donor worker callbacks.
