//! The games the launcher installs and runs (TASK-101, release 1.3.0, owner 2026-10-23;

//! Two games side by side: Gran Turismo 4 v2.00 (retail, SCUS-97328) and Gran Turismo 4 Spec II 1.10 (SCUS-97436
//! lineage). The ids (`gt4`, `spec2`) are used in folder names, settings and logs; the display names are only for the

//! prepared files, runtime card, save library and replays. Settings, controls, GSdx and the textures are shared.
