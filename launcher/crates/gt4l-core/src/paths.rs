//! Where the launcher keeps its files (TASK-091, release 1.2.1, owner 2026-10-22).
//!
//! Two places, and nothing found through the registry or a stored absolute path:
//!
//! - **Large data** lives in `<install folder>\data`, found relative to `GT4Recomp.exe` ([`DataDirs`]): the disc
//!   image copy, the prepared game files, the gt4-gs versions with their caches, the runtime card, sessions, logs
//!   and the custom textures folder. The whole program folder can be copied to another drive or PC and started from
//!   there (portable). When `<install>\data` exists but cannot be written (a copy into Program Files made without
//!   the installer), it is still read, and new writes go to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` (logged).
//! - **User data** lives per Windows user in `%APPDATA%\GT4Recomp` ([`UserDirs`]): settings, controls, the save
//!   library (`Saves`, `Replays`) and the card backups.
//!
//! Launchers 1.0.0 to 1.2.0 kept the large data in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GT4Recomp` and the save library in
//! `Documents\Gran Turismo 4`. The launcher moves both at its first start ([`crate::relocate`]); until that has
//! happened (a failed copy, or the game running), the old places stay in use ([`LegacyLocations`]).
//!
//! A reinstall into another folder leaves the data of the old folder behind; the setup records it as
//! `PreviousDataDir` (HKLM), and the launcher moves its large data the same way at its first start
//! ([`LegacyLocations::previous_data`]). Until then that folder is a read layer too.
